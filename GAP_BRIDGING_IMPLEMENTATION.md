# 🚀 GAP BRIDGING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## Making the Website Match the GraphRAG Vision

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Author:** Kaitiaki Aronui V3.0
**Status:** COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

---

## 📊 **THE FUNDAMENTAL GAP**

### **GraphRAG Reality (What SHOULD Exist):**
- **17,457 resources** cataloged and connected
- **239,128 relationships** creating sophisticated knowledge graph
- **36.2% cultural integration** (Te Ao Māori: 98.14%!)
- **86.55 average quality** across all content

### **Website Reality (What Currently Exists):**
- **~2,000 HTML files** actually deployed
- **37 lesson files** in main lessons directory
- **Inconsistent styling** and broken components
- **Navigation fragmentation** (multiple competing systems)

### **The Gap (What We Need to Build):**
- **15,457 resources** exist in GraphRAG but not implemented on website
- **Massive relationship network** not reflected in user experience
- **Cultural integration** not systematically applied
- **Quality standards** not consistently achieved

---

## 🎯 **GRAPHRAG-INFORMED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Core Philosophy:**
1. **GraphRAG as Authoritative Blueprint** - Use it to understand what should exist
2. **Systematic Deployment** - Deploy resources in GraphRAG's priority order
3. **Relationship-First Design** - Build connections as we deploy
4. **Cultural Integration Priority** - Apply cultural frameworks during deployment

---

## 📋 **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION DEPLOYMENT (Week 1)**
**Target:** Deploy 5,000+ resources using GraphRAG subject priorities

#### **3.1 Perfect Learning Chains**
```sql
-- GraphRAG shows these patterns exist
SELECT * FROM find_learning_pathway('/units/lessons/unit-1-lesson-1.html', 5);
```
**Model:** Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga (18 lessons, confidence 1.0)
**Targets:**
- Y7 Algebra (5 lessons)
- Y9 Ecology (6+ lessons)
- Y10 units (NCEA preparation)

#### **3.2 Year Level Progression**
- **Current:** Isolated year levels
- **GraphRAG Shows:** 64,003 same_year_level connections
- **Target:** Complete prerequisite chains Y7→Y13

#### **3.3 Cultural Framework Threading**
- **Current:** Inconsistent cultural elements
- **GraphRAG Shows:** 5,273 shared_cultural_element connections
- **Target:** Te Whare Tapa Whā, Pūrākau, Toi Māori frameworks

---

### **PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURE DEPLOYMENT (Month 2-3)**
**Target:** Implement sophisticated features GraphRAG assumes exist

#### **4.1 Search & Discovery System**
```sql
-- GraphRAG assumes sophisticated search
SELECT * FROM get_smart_recommendations('/lessons/unit-1-lesson-1.html', 5);
```
**Current:** Basic search functionality
**Target:** GraphRAG-powered intelligent discovery

#### **4.2 Hub Organization**
- **Current:** Scattered content
- **GraphRAG Shows:** Sophisticated taxonomy
- **Target:** Subject hubs with cultural frameworks

#### **4.3 Teacher Ecosystem**
- **Current:** Missing assignment systems
- **GraphRAG Assumes:** Complete teacher workflows
- **Target:** My Kete, progress tracking, assignment management

## 🧠 **GRAPHRAG QUERY PATTERNS FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Resource Discovery:**
```sql
-- Find resources ready for deployment
SELECT file_path, title, subject, quality_score, cultural_context
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE file_path NOT LIKE '/public/%'
AND quality_score >= 80
ORDER BY subject, quality_score DESC;
```

### **Cultural Integration Planning:**
```sql
-- Find subjects needing cultural boost
SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as resources,
       AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality,
       (COUNT(CASE WHEN cultural_context = true THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as cultural_pct
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE quality_score >= 85
GROUP BY subject
ORDER BY cultural_pct;
```

### **Learning Progression Building:**
```sql
-- Find existing prerequisite chains to extend
SELECT source_path, target_path, confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE relationship_type = 'prerequisite_for'
AND confidence >= 0.90
ORDER BY confidence DESC;
```

### **Quality Gap Analysis:**
```sql
-- Identify resources below quality target
SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as below_target,
       AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE quality_score < 86.55
GROUP BY subject
ORDER BY below_target DESC;
```
