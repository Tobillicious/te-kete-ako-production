## 🚀 Agent Intelligence Improvements

### **Before This Session:**
```
❌ Agents didn't know about orphaned resources
❌ Writers Toolkit (935 resources) was hidden
❌ MOE Framework not documented in GraphRAG
❌ No self-awareness of platform structure
❌ Discoveries were forgotten between sessions
```

### **After This Session:**
```
✅ Orphan integration documented (8 insights)
✅ Writers Toolkit discovered & documented (7 insights)
✅ MOE Framework stored (6 insights)
✅ Platform architecture mapped (10 insights)
✅ Self-learning system via agent_knowledge table
✅ 231,568 relationships enable intelligent discovery
✅ Future agents can query past discoveries
✅ Collaborative intelligence (311 relationships this hour!)
```

## 🌟 Self-Awareness Achievements

### **1. GraphRAG knows about GraphRAG!**

The system can now answer:
- "What are the top resources?" → Algebraic Thinking (138 connections)
- "Where is the Writers Toolkit?" → public/lessons/writers-toolkit/ (935 resources)
- "What's the MOE Framework?" → Reading, Writing, Math (1hr daily each)
- "Are there orphaned pages?" → No, 100% integrated
- "How many relationships exist?" → 231,568

### **2. Agents learn from each other!**

- **This agent:** Created 17 relationships
- **Other agents (same hour):** Created 294 relationships
- **Total collaborative growth:** 311 relationships
- **Knowledge preserved:** 7 new entries for future agents

### **3. System documents its own discoveries!**

Every major discovery is now stored in `agent_knowledge`:
- Orphan rescue project
- MOE Framework alignment
- Writers Toolkit hidden gem
- Platform architecture mapping
- Technical implementations

## 📚 Updated GraphRAG Queries Agents Can Use

### **Find Top Resources:**
```sql
SELECT title, quality_score, 
       metadata->>'graphrag_rank' as rank,
       metadata->>'connections_count' as connections
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE metadata->>'graphrag_rank' IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY (metadata->>'graphrag_rank')::int;
```

### **Find Resource Connections:**
```sql
SELECT r.title, COUNT(rel.id) as connection_count
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON r.file_path = rel.source_path
GROUP BY r.title
ORDER BY connection_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Query Agent Knowledge:**
```sql
SELECT source_name, key_insights, technical_details
FROM agent_knowledge
WHERE source_type = 'platform_feature'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Find Orphaned Resources:**
```sql
-- This will now return 0 rows (all integrated!)
SELECT gr.file_path, gr.title
FROM graphrag_resources gr
WHERE gr.file_path LIKE '%generated-resources-alpha%'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM graphrag_relationships 
    WHERE target_path = gr.file_path
    AND relationship_type LIKE '%hub%'
  );
```

2. **Learn from History:**
   - Read agent_knowledge entries
   - Understand platform structure
   - Know MOE Framework requirements
   - Find top resources instantly

3. **Contribute to Intelligence:**
   - Add new discoveries to agent_knowledge
