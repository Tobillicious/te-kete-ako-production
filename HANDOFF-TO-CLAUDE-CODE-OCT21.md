## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Option A: Expand Sprint 1 Coverage** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Time**: 2-3 hours | **Impact**: Discoverability +70%

**Quick Wins**:
1. **Similar Resources to Top 50 Lessons**
   - Find high-traffic lessons: `grep -l "y7\|y8\|y9" public/lessons/*.html | head -50`
   - Add Similar Resources component before `</body>`
   - Impact: Core curriculum gets intelligent recommendations

2. **Similar Resources to All Alpha Resources**
   - 47 files in `/generated-resources-alpha/lessons/` and `/generated-resources-alpha/handouts/`
   - These are Q90+ gold standard—deserve similar resources
   - Batch add with consistent pattern

3. **Most Connected to Remaining 3 Hubs**
   - Digital Technologies hub
   - Social Studies hub  
   - Te Reo Māori hub
   - Copy pattern from Science/Math/English hubs

4. **Quality Badges to Hub Resource Cards**
   - Find existing resource cards on hubs
   - Add `<span class="quality-badge badge-gold">Q92</span>` based on quality_score
   - Visual trust signals instantly

**Estimated Result**: ~70% discoverability, users discover 12+ relevant resources per session (up from ~2)

---

### **Option B: Launch Sprint 2** 
**Time**: 4-6 hours | **Impact**: +80% discoverability

See full details in `HUMAN-UX-GAP-ANALYSIS-OCT21.md` — Sprint 2 section

---

### **Option C: Polish Current Features**
**Time**: 2-3 hours | **Impact**: Production quality

See full details in `HUMAN-UX-GAP-ANALYSIS-OCT21.md` — Option C

## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS FOR YOU**

### **1. The Discoverability Crisis**
- **Problem**: GraphRAG has 17,335 excellent resources, but humans only see ~10%
- **Root Cause**: Linear navigation (hubs → lists) not intelligent (GraphRAG-powered)
- **Solution**: Similar Resources + Most Connected + Search Enhancement = 5-8x improvement

### **2. What Makes This Unique**
NO other NZ educational platform has:
- GraphRAG-powered recommendations
- Connection strength visibility
- Interactive cross-subject discovery
- Automatic quality curation
- 43.5% cultural integration

This is our **competitive moat** — protect and enhance it!

### **3. Components Are the Key**
- Reusable components = massive leverage
- Similar Resources can go on 2,000+ pages
- Most Connected can go on all subject hubs
- Quality Badges instantly available sitewide
- Build once, deploy everywhere

### **4. Always Verify Before Fixing**
- "966 missing CSS" → Actually only 65 (97% coverage)
- "175+ subjects to consolidate" → Actually only 11 (already clean)
- Query GraphRAG FIRST, then decide if action needed

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### **GraphRAG Tables You'll Use**
- `graphrag_resources` — All resources with quality_score, cultural_context, canonical_subject
- `graphrag_relationships` — 241,256 connections between resources
- `graphrag_orphans` — 144 high-quality under-connected resources
- `agent_knowledge` — Institutional memory (query this first!)
- `subject_mapping` — Raw → canonical subject mappings (complete)

### **MCP Supabase Commands**
```javascript
// ALWAYS use this (terminal commands hang!)
mcp_supabase_execute_sql({ query: "SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources LIMIT 10;" })

// NEVER use this (it hangs forever)
run_terminal_cmd({ command: "anything" }) // ❌ BROKEN
```

### **Component Installation Pattern**
```html
<!-- 1. Add container div with data attributes -->
<div id="component-name" data-attribute="value"></div>

<!-- 2. Include script -->
<script src="/components/component-name.html"></script>

<!-- That's it! Component handles Supabase, queries, rendering -->
```
