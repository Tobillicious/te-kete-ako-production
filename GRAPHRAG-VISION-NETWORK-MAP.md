## 📊 **GRAPHRAG QUERY EXAMPLES**

### **Query 1: Find all documents that fulfill the Grand Vision**
```sql
SELECT 
  r.title,
  r.type,
  rel.confidence_score,
  rel.metadata->>'insight' as insight
FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN resources r ON r.id = rel.source_resource_id
WHERE rel.target_resource_id = (
  SELECT id FROM resources 
  WHERE title = 'Grand Vision Strategic Roadmap - July 2025'
)
AND rel.relationship_type = 'fulfills_plan'
ORDER BY rel.confidence_score DESC;
```

**Result:**
```
Professional SaaS Transformation | 0.96 | "October 26 SaaS request fulfills July vision"
```

### **Query 2: Trace vision from July to October**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE vision_path AS (
  -- Start with Grand Vision
  SELECT id, title, 0 as depth
  FROM resources
  WHERE title = 'Grand Vision Strategic Roadmap - July 2025'
  
  UNION
  
  -- Find all downstream documents
  SELECT r.id, r.title, vp.depth + 1
  FROM vision_path vp
  JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON rel.source_resource_id = vp.id
  JOIN resources r ON r.id = rel.target_resource_id
