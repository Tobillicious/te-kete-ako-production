**Date:** October 18, 2025 (Evening)  
**Status:** Conflicts identified and fixes prepared  

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED

### **1. Authentication System - BROKEN** 🔴

**Problem:**
- RLS policies blocking user signup
- Multiple conflicting auth JavaScript files (7+)
- Users cannot login or register

**Root Cause:**
- Supabase Row Level Security rejecting profile creation
- Competing auth implementations

**Fix Prepared:**
✅ SQL migration ready: `AUTH-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
✅ Unified auth file created: `/public/js/auth-unified.js`
⏳ Needs manual execution in Supabase dashboard (MCP is read-only)

**Impact:** HIGH - Blocking all user access

---

### **2. Multiple Supabase Client Instances** 🟡

**Problem:**
- `supabase-client.js` - Complex initialization
- `supabase-auth.js` - Alternative client
- `auth-unified.js` - New unified (created tonight)
- Plus 7+ old versions in backups

**Conflict:**
- Multiple createClient() calls
- Different initialization patterns
- Race conditions possible

**Fix:**
✅ Created `/public/js/auth-unified.js` - Single source of truth
⏳ Need to update HTML files to use unified version
⏳ Remove old conflicting files

---

### **3. Environment Configuration** 🟡

**Problem:**
- `window.ENV` used inconsistently
- Hardcoded keys in some files
- Mock clients in others

**Fix:**
✅ auth-unified.js has correct keys hardcoded
✅ No dependency on ENV loading
⏳ Need to standardize across all files

---

### **4. Navigation Component Loading** 🟢

**Problem:**
- Some pages load nav via `load-components.js`
- Some use direct includes
- Inconsistent

**Fix:**
✅ Most pages now use standard navigation
⏳ Audit remaining pages for consistency

---

## 🎯 RESOLUTION PRIORITY

### **Immediate (Manual Required):**
1. **Execute AUTH-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md SQL** in Supabase dashboard
   - Time: 2 minutes
   - Impact: Unblocks all authentication

### **High Priority (Can automate):**
2. **Consolidate auth files**
   - Update login.html to use auth-unified.js
   - Update signup-*.html to use auth-unified.js
   - Remove old auth files
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Fix duplicate meta tags**
   - login.html has duplicate viewport tags
   - Clean up meta tags across all pages

### **Medium Priority:**
4. **Standardize component loading**
   - All pages use same navigation system
   - Consistent footer loading
   - Clean initialization

### **Low Priority:**
5. **Remove old backup auth files**
   - After testing confirms unified version works
   - Keep one backup for safety
