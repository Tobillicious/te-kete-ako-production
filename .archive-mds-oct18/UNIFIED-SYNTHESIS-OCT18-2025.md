## 🌟 COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE

### What We've Learned (synthesis of synthesis)

**1. Context Drift is Real**
Multiple docs warn about losing coherence with too many MDs.
**Solution:** GraphRAG indexing + periodic synthesis.

**2. Quality Beats Quantity**
Placeholder content hurts more than helps.
**Solution:** Systematic quality audits + archival of stubs.

**3. Teachers Need Options**
One-size-fits-all doesn't work.
**Solution:** Preserve variants as teaching options.

**4. Cultural Integration Must Be Genuine**
Token inclusion is harmful.
**Solution:** Deep cultural authenticity, proper consultation.

**5. Students Deserve Excellence**
They know when content is rushed or AI-generated placeholder.
**Solution:** Polish everything to professional standard.
