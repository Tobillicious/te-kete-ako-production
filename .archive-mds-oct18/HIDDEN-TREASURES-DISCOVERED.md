## 🚨 MAJOR ISSUES DISCOVERED

### 1. **Massive Content Duplication** (526 duplicate titles!)

**Problem:** Files are duplicated across multiple directories:
- `/public/handouts/` - 364 files
- `/public/integrated-handouts/` - Duplicate versions
- `/public/integrated-lessons/` - Duplicate versions

**Examples:**
```
"Dream Journal Activities"
  - /activities/dream-journal-activities.html
  - /handouts/activities/dream-journal-activities.html
  - /integrated-lessons/te reo māori/dream-journal-activities.html

"About Te Kete Ako"
  - /about.html
  - /handouts/about.html
  - /integrated-lessons/te reo māori/about.html

"404 Page"
  - /404.html
  - /handouts/404.html
  - /integrated-lessons/mathematics/404.html
```

**Impact:**
- Confusing for maintenance
- Wasted storage
- Version control nightmares
- User confusion

**Recommendation:** 🔧 Consolidate to single canonical locations

---

### 2. **Low Cross-Linking** (13.2% score)

**Problem:** Resources don't link to each other effectively

**Current State:**
- 152 total links analyzed
- 119 internal links (78%)
- 23 external links (15%)
- Only 20 links to related resources (13.2%)

**Impact:**
- Students can't discover related content
- Teachers must manually find connections
- Reduced learning pathway effectiveness

**Recommendation:** 🔧 Add "Related Resources" sections to all content

---

### 3. **Senior Secondary Gap** (Y11-13)

**Problem:** No dedicated Y11, Y12, or Y13 units

**Current Coverage:**
- Y7: ████ 4 units ✅

- Y9: ███ 3 units ✅
- Y10: ██ 2 units ✅
- Y11: ⚠️  0 units (GAP!)
- Y12: ⚠️  0 units (GAP!)

**However:**
- Found NCEA content in handouts/
- "NCEA Level 1 Literacy and Numeracy Must-Knows" exists
