## 🎯 THE REAL ISSUE:

**Your preferred navigation has MOCK/PLACEHOLDER links!**

This is the OLD navigation with example links that were never connected to real pages.

- Update navigation to point to REAL pages
- Remove non-existent dropdown items
- Keep only working links

### Option B: Use Simpler Navigation (5 min)
- Use navigation-mega-menu.html (which was in production)
- It has working links
- Less pretty but functional

### Option C: Hybrid (15 min)
- Keep the beautiful dropdown design
- Replace links with working ones from mega-menu
