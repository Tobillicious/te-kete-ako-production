# üéØ SYSTEMATIC QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Active Quality Enhancement Campaign

## üìä THE REAL NUMBERS

- **Total Files:** 87,116 (2.4GB)
- **Educational Content:** 6,850 resources indexed
- **Words Indexed:** 3,968,503
- **Quality Issues:** 2,714 files need fixes

---

## üö® PRIORITY 1: PLACEHOLDER ELIMINATION

### Files with "Coming Soon" (928 files)
**Action:** Either fill with real content OR archive

**Systematic Approach:**
1. Identify which 928 files
2. Categorize by type (handout/lesson/other)
3. For each: Either write real content OR move to archive
4. Track progress in batches of 50

### Files with "Placeholder" Text (1,756 files)
**Action:** Replace with meaningful content

**Systematic Approach:**
1. Extract the 1,756 file paths
2. Prioritize by:
   - Public-facing (highest priority)
   - Word count (longer files = more effort to fix)
   - Category (handouts/lessons first)
3. Fix in batches of 20, verify each
4. Re-index after each batch

## üé® PRIORITY 2: CULTURAL ENHANCEMENT

### 75 Resources Missing Cultural Content
**Action:** Add meaningful cultural connections

**Systematic Approach:**
1. List all 75 files
2. For each resource:
   - Read existing content
   - Find relevant whakataukƒ´
   - Connect to College Values
   - Add cultural context section
3. Verify quality before moving to next
4. Track in CULTURAL-FIX-LOG.json

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è PRIORITY 3: TREASURE HUNTING

### 101 Potential Hidden Gems
**Directories to explore:**
- `templates/` (18 files)
- `development/` (31 files)
- `project/` (52 files)

**Systematic Approach:**
1. Scan each directory
2. Quality-score each file (0-10)
3. Surface gems (8+) to homepage/indexes
4. Archive low-quality (<5)
5. Improve mid-quality (5-7)
