## 📊 **KEY FINDINGS FROM GRAPHRAG:**

### **Oct 16 - Navigation Standardization (Kaitiaki Aronui)**

**Commit:** `c130a10c` - "fix: standardize navigation across all 215 pages"

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Standardized navigation across **215 pages** (99% success rate)
- ✅ All pages use **navigation-mega-menu.html** component
- ✅ Fixed user issue: "different headers on different pages"
- ✅ Result: "Site is now 100% consistent and professional"

**Impact:**
- This WAS the beautiful navigation work!
- It used `navigation-mega-menu.html`
- It was successful on 215 pages

---

## 🤔 **THE PROBLEM:**

**What GraphRAG Tells Us:**
- Beautiful navigation = `navigation-mega-menu.html` ✅
- It was successfully deployed to 215 pages ✅
- User was happy with it ✅

**What User Reports Now:**
- Seeing OLD navigation (not the beautiful mega-menu) ❌
- Cache clearing didn't fix it ❌

**Possible Explanation:**
- Recent changes may have broken what Kaitiaki Aronui built
- OR index.html was modified after Oct 16
- OR the navigation component was changed

---

## 🎯 **ACTION PLAN:**

### **Step 1: Check What Changed**
Compare current index.html to the working version from c130a10c

### **Step 2: Verify Component**
Check if navigation-mega-menu.html is still the beautiful version

### **Step 3: Restore If Needed**
If something broke after Oct 16, restore the working version

---

## 💡 **HYPOTHESIS:**

The beautiful navigation WAS working on Oct 16.

Something changed between then and now that broke it.

Need to find what changed and restore it.
