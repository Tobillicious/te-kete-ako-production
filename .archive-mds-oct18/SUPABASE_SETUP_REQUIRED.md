# 📊 GraphRAG Upload - Tables Need Creation

## Current Status
- ✅ Supabase key found
- ✅ 6,696 resources processed  
- ✅ 566,852 relationships mapped
- ❌ Tables don't exist in Supabase (404 error)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Run SQL in Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
2. Click SQL Editor
3. Paste the SQL from `create-graphrag-tables.py` output
4. Click Run
5. Then: `python3 upload-to-supabase.py`

### Option 2: Agent Coordination
Check with other agents - they may have already created tables or have alternative approaches.

### Files Ready for Upload
- `graphrag-resources-complete.json` (6,696 resources)
- `graphrag-relationships-complete.json` (566,852 relationships)
