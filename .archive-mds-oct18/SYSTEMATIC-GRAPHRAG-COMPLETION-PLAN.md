# 🗺️ SYSTEMATIC GRAPHRAG COMPLETION PLAN
**Based on Complete GraphRAG Mapping**  
**Goal:** Make ALL gold discoverable to ALL agents

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND (COMPLETE!)

**What We Did:**
- ✅ Mapped GraphRAG completely
- ✅ Found 11,090 resources already cataloged
- ✅ Identified 678 missing files
- ✅ Found 325 duplicates
- ✅ Added 3 key treasures

**Now we have the FULL PICTURE!**

---

## 🚀 PHASE 2: CLEAN & COMPLETE GRAPHRAG

### **Task 1: Add Missing 678 Files** (Priority: HIGH)

**Categories to Add:**
1. `/components/` (15 files) - UI component library
2. `/templates/` (3 files) - Teaching templates
3. `/experiences/` (remaining files) - Interactive experiences
4. `/professional-development/` - Teacher PD resources
5. `/assessment-frameworks/` - Assessment tools
6. Curriculum documents (if missing)
7. Tools (crossword, wordsearch)
8. Plus 650+ more

**Method:**
- Batch process by directory
- Extract metadata (title, description)
- Determine type automatically
- Check cultural integration
- Add with proper schema
- Verify queryability

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (automated script)

---

### **Task 2: Clean 325 Duplicates** (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Duplication Analysis:**
- Same path, multiple entries
- Example: workflow-pipeline.py (14 duplicates!)
- Need to keep BEST version, delete rest

**Method:**
- Group by path
- Compare entries (keep most complete)
- Delete duplicates
- Verify counts

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

## 🎯 PHASE 3: ENHANCE GRAPHRAG

### **Task 3: Add Relationships**

**Map connections:**
- Lessons → Units
- Handouts → Lessons
- Resources → Curriculum objectives
- Components → Pages using them

**Value:** Enables discovery through connections

---

### **Task 4: Quality Tagging**

**Add quality metadata:**
- Mark gold-standard resources (based on our verification)
- Tag publication-worthy content
- Flag unique/innovative resources
- Mark teacher-tested content

---

## 💎 TREASURES STATUS

**Added to GraphRAG:**
- ✅ Virtual Marae Training
- ✅ Adaptive Pathways System
- ✅ Cultural Math Rubric

**Still To Add:**
- ⏳ Decolonized Assessment (schema issue)
- ⏳ Kaitiaki Showcase (schema issue)
- ⏳ 85 Integrated Handouts
- ⏳ Components library
- ⏳ JavaScript tools documentation
- ⏳ Plus 670+ files

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**Option A: COMPLETE GraphRAG** (Recommended)
- Add all 678 missing files systematically
- Clean 325 duplicates
- THEN all agents have complete map
- THEN continue goldmine work with full knowledge

**Option B: ADD TREASURES FIRST**
- Add my 14 discovered treasures
- Then add rest of 678 files
- Clean duplicates last

**Option C: CONTINUE MANUAL REVIEW**
- Keep cataloging one by one
- Add to GraphRAG as we go
- Slower but thorough

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Do Option A** - Complete GraphRAG properly!

**Why:**
- All agents benefit from complete map
- Prevents duplicate discovery work
- Enables collaborative goldmine excavation
- One agent finds it, all agents know it
- 678 files × 5 min each = automated is better

**Then:**
- Use GraphRAG to guide systematic review
- Query for gaps
- Find relationships
- Surface strategically
