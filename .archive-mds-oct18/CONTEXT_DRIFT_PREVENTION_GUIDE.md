# 🛡️ CONTEXT DRIFT PREVENTION GUIDE

## Purpose
Prevent navigation fragmentation and component inconsistencies in future development.

---

## ✅ CURRENT STANDARD (Oct 17, 2025)

### Navigation Component
**File:** `/public/components/navigation-standard.html`  
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE - DO NOT REPLACE  
**Coverage:** 677 pages (100%)  
**User Approved:** Yes ⭐

### Why This Navigation?
- User's explicit preference ("the dropdown header thing I liked")
- Beautiful design with cultural markers
- Professional dropdowns with SVG icons
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- 16KB optimized component

---

## 🚫 DEPRECATED COMPONENTS

### DO NOT USE:
- ❌ `navigation-mega-menu.html` - Replaced Oct 17, 2025
- ❌ `professional-navigation.html` - Unused variant
- ❌ `header-enhanced.html` - Legacy
- ❌ `header-next-level.html` - Experimental

### If You Find These:
**DO NOT** update pages to use them. They exist for historical reference only.

## 📋 RULES FOR AGENTS

### Navigation Changes
1. **ALWAYS** consult user before creating new navigation
2. **NEVER** create navigation variants without approval
3. **CHECK** for existing navigation in `/components/` first
4. **DISCUSS** proposed changes with other agents (MCP coordination)
5. **TEST** on 3+ pages before platform-wide deployment

### Component Development
1. **SEARCH** existing components before creating new ones
2. **DOCUMENT** why a new component is needed
3. **MARK** old components as deprecated (don't just leave them)
4. **UPDATE** this guide when changing standards

### Multi-Agent Coordination
1. **ANNOUNCE** component changes in coordination channel
2. **WAIT** for approval from lead agent or user
3. **BATCH** related changes together
4. **VERIFY** consistency across platform after changes

## 🔍 DETECTING CONTEXT DRIFT

### Warning Signs:
- Multiple components doing the same thing
- Different navigation on different pages
- User reports inconsistent experience
- Multiple CSS classes for same element (`.site-header-*`)
- Orphaned/unused components in `/components/`

### Monthly Audit Checklist:
- [ ] Count navigation variants: Should be 1
- [ ] Verify CSS consistency: `grep -r "beautiful-navigation.css"`
- [ ] Check component loading: All pages use `navigation-standard.html`
- [ ] Review `/components/` directory for bloat
- [ ] Test navigation on 5 random pages

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Creating New Navigation:
- [ ] User requested change?
- [ ] Existing navigation insufficient?
- [ ] Discussed with team/other agents?
- [ ] Backward compatibility considered?
- [ ] Migration plan prepared?

### During Deployment:
- [ ] Update standardized component (don't create new)
- [ ] Test on 3-5 pages first
- [ ] Batch update all pages at once
- [ ] Update service-worker.js cache
- [ ] Verify 0 old references remain

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Document in git commit
- [ ] Update this guide if standard changed
- [ ] Notify other agents via MCP
- [ ] Create rollback plan
- [ ] Monitor for issues

---

## 📞 ESCALATION

### When to Ask User:
- Navigation doesn't look right
- Considering new navigation component
- User feedback about navigation
- Performance issues with current nav
- Accessibility concerns

### When to Coordinate with Agents:
- Platform-wide changes (>50 files)
- New component creation
- CSS framework changes
- Component deprecation

---

## 🔒 PROTECTION MECHANISMS

### File Protection:
```bash
# Mark standard navigation as important
# DO NOT DELETE: /public/components/navigation-standard.html
```

### Version Control:
- Navigation changes require commit message: "NAVIGATION: [change description]"
- Tag major navigation updates: `git tag nav-v1.0`

### Automated Checks (Future):
```bash
# Check for navigation drift
nav_count=$(find public/components -name "navigation-*.html" | wc -l)
if [ $nav_count -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Multiple navigation components detected"
fi
```

## 📚 REFERENCE

### Current Platform Statistics (Oct 17, 2025):
- Total HTML files: 1,579
- Files with navigation: 677
- Navigation component: navigation-standard.html
- CSS coverage: 90.4% (beautiful-navigation.css)
- Navigation consistency: 100%

### Key Files:
- Standard Nav: `/public/components/navigation-standard.html`
- Navigation CSS: `/public/css/beautiful-navigation.css`
- Service Worker: `/public/service-worker.js`
- Audit Report: `/CONTEXT_DRIFT_AUDIT_OCT17.md`

## 🎓 LESSONS FROM OCT 17, 2025 INCIDENT

### What Happened:
- 12 agents working simultaneously
- Multiple navigation components created independently
- No coordination mechanism enforced
- User's preferred nav got archived
- 55 commits of navigation drift

### How We Fixed It:
1. Comprehensive audit (1,579 files)
2. Identified user preference
3. Standardized component created
4. Batch updated 677 files
5. Documented everything

### Prevention Going Forward:
- This guide exists
- MCP coordination required
- User preferences documented
- Regular audits scheduled
- Component registry maintained
