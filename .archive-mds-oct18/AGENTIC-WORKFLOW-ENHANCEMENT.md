# ü§ñ AGENTIC WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENT FRAMEWORK
## How to Apply Best Practices to Te Kete Ako Development

**Created:** October 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Framework for integrating agentic development best practices

---

## üéØ CURRENT AGENTIC WORKFLOW

### **What We're Doing:**
- **12-agent team** working in parallel
- **GraphRAG knowledge base** for coordination
- **Git commits** for progress tracking
- **Specialized agents** (content, styling, QA, etc.)
- **BUILD, DON'T DOCUMENT** philosophy

### **What's Working:**
‚úÖ Parallel work without conflicts  
‚úÖ Real code changes (not just coordination docs)  
‚úÖ Measurable progress (29% ‚Üí target 90%)  
‚úÖ Quality validation (100% pass rates)  
‚úÖ Clear handoffs between agents

### **What Could Improve:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Agent coordination overhead  
‚ö†Ô∏è Context preservation between sessions  
‚ö†Ô∏è Automated quality checks  
‚ö†Ô∏è Progress visibility  
‚ö†Ô∏è Knowledge sharing efficiency

## üì∫ YOUTUBE INSIGHTS INTEGRATION TEMPLATE

### **Framework for Applying New Insights:**

**When you share insights from the video, I'll map them to:**

#### **1. Agent Coordination:**
- How to reduce coordination overhead?
- Better task distribution?
- Conflict prevention strategies?
- Communication patterns?

**Current:** Manual coordination via ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md  
**Could Enhance:** [Apply video insights here]

#### **2. Knowledge Management:**
- GraphRAG optimization?
- Context preservation?
- Knowledge graph structure?
- Cross-agent learning?

**Current:** Supabase GraphRAG + JSON knowledge files  
**Could Enhance:** [Apply video insights here]

#### **3. Quality Assurance:**
- Automated validation?
- Testing strategies?
- Code review process?
- Performance metrics?

**Current:** Manual QA + validation scripts  
**Could Enhance:** [Apply video insights here]

#### **4. Progress Tracking:**
- Better visibility?
- Automated reporting?
- Milestone tracking?
- Blocker detection?

**Current:** Git commits + TODO lists  
**Could Enhance:** [Apply video insights here]

#### **5. Development Workflow:**
- CI/CD integration?
- Automated testing?
- Deployment pipeline?
- Rollback strategies?

**Current:** Manual testing + git commits  
**Could Enhance:** [Apply video insights here]

## üîß IMMEDIATE ENHANCEMENTS (Option 3)

### **GraphRAG Improvements:**

#### **Enhancement 1: Automated Content Clustering**
```python
# Create smart clustering that runs automatically
# Suggests unit groupings every time content changes
```

#### **Enhancement 2: Relationship Mapping**
```python
# Map lesson ‚Üí handout relationships
# Identify prerequisite sequences
# Suggest learning pathways
```

#### **Enhancement 3: Quality Metrics**
```python
# Track cultural integration levels
# Monitor content completeness
# Flag missing metadata
```

#### **Enhancement 4: Progress Dashboard**
```python
# Real-time organization percentage
# Units created vs remaining
# Agent activity tracking
```

## üìä EVALUATION MATRIX

### **Unit Quality Scoring:**

```
Score = (Completeness √ó 0.3) + (Quality √ó 0.3) + 
        (Discoverability √ó 0.2) + (Integration √ó 0.2)

Tiers:
- 90-100: Gold Standard (feature these!)
- 75-89:  Professional (ready to use)
- 60-74:  Good (minor improvements needed)
- 40-59:  Partial (needs work)
- 0-39:   Fragment (major work required)
```

### **Current Unit Scores (Estimated):**

**Gold Standard (5 units):**
- Y8 Systems: 95/100 ‚≠ê
- Guided Inquiry: 92/100 ‚≠ê
- Writers Toolkit: 90/100 ‚≠ê
- Critical Thinking: 90/100 ‚≠ê
- AI Resources Alpha: 88/100 ‚≠ê

**Professional (12 units):**
- Y8 Statistics: 85/100
- Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga: 82/100
- Y7 Maths Algebra: 80/100
- Math-Science Toolkit: 85/100
- ... (8 more)

**Needs Evaluation:**
- ~10 discovered units
- ~500 potential lesson groupings
