## üö® **CRITICAL TECHNICAL ISSUE - TOP PRIORITY**

### **Supabase RLS Policy Recursion Problem**

**Issue:** `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`

**Impact:** 
- ‚ùå Cannot read/write to Supabase database
- ‚ùå Prevents resource integration script from running
- ‚ùå May affect authentication on live site

**Files Ready:**
- `execute-resource-integration.js` - Script ready to run once RLS fixed
- `CORRECTED_SUPABASE_RESOURCE_INTEGRATION.sql` - 14+ resources ready to integrate

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Access Supabase Dashboard:** https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co
2. **Check RLS Policies** on `profiles` table - look for circular references
3. **Likely fix:** Policies referencing each other creating infinite loop
4. **Test:** Simple `SELECT * FROM profiles LIMIT 1` should work after fix
5. **Then run:** `node execute-resource-integration.js` to add discovered resources
