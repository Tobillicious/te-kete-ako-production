## üöÄ YOUR DECISION

**Which path do you want to take?**

**A) Continue manual review** - Find ALL the gold first  
**B) Start surfacing what we found** - Make the 8 treasures accessible  
**C) Focus on completing the incomplete** - Finish Living Whakapapa etc  
**D) Combination approach** - Continue cataloging WHILE surfacing key items  

---

**My recommendation:** Option D - Continue cataloging but START featuring the world-class items (Virtual Marae, 377 lessons, NZ Curriculum)
