## üéØ **POSSIBLE SITEWIDE CAUSES**

### **Hypothesis 1: Missing Critical CSS Classes**
- Many pages use classes that don't exist in CSS
- Browser falls back to default (broken) rendering
- **Need:** Comprehensive CSS class audit

### **Hypothesis 2: CSS Load Order**
- Critical CSS not loading first
- Inline styles override intended design
- **Need:** Check CSS load order

### **Hypothesis 3: Conflicting Styles**
- Multiple CSS files with conflicting rules
- Some pages get wrong combination
- **Need:** CSS consolidation

### **Hypothesis 4: JavaScript Breaking CSS Application**
- JS error prevents dynamic styling
- Components don't initialize properly
- **Need:** Check for early JS errors

1. What CSS files are supposed to load on ALL pages?
2. What critical classes are missing sitewide?

4. What's the correct CSS architecture?
