## 🧠 Key Insights from This Session

**Socratic Self-Questioning Works:**
- Ask "What does a teacher NEED?" not "What looks professional?"
- Challenge every element's PURPOSE
- If it doesn't help teachers do their job, cut it

**Link Specificity Matters:**
- Don't link to homepages
- Find actual planning tools, templates, frameworks
- Verify links work before adding

**NZC Compliance is Non-Negotiable:**
- Use official bilingual learning area names
- Don't invent new categories
- Te Ao Māori replaces Learning Languages

**Subtle > Obvious:**
- PLU codes barely visible until hover
- Year badges minimal but functional
- Micro-animations enhance, don't distract

## 📊 GraphRAG Updates

- **Update #1:** Initial clean build state
- **Update #2:** After navigation fixes and link repairs
- **Update #3:** After unit-plans.html complete polish ← CURRENT

All knowledge exports in: `graphrag-knowledge-oct27-clean-build-*.json`

## 🚀 When You Return

1. Server should still be running on port 8001
2. Pick up with `lessons.html` polish using established pattern
3. Reference this guide + graphrag-knowledge-oct27-clean-build-3.json
4. Apply same Socratic thinking: function over decoration

**Kia kaha! See you soon! 🧺**
