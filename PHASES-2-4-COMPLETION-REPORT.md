- Culturally grounded title + whakatauki
- 4-card discovery grid
- Mix of specific lessons + hubs + search queries
- Consistent visual language (border-left color coding)
- Call-to-action with relevant destination

**Can be applied to:**

- All concept pages
- Subject hub "getting started" sections

### 2. **Interactive Beta Checklist** (Innovation!)
LocalStorage persistence means beta testers can:
- Complete checklist over 2 weeks
- Return to see progress
- Know exactly what to test
- Feel guided and supported

This is a **professional-grade** beta testing experience.

### 3. **Cross-Curricular Bridge Building** (GraphRAG Excellence)
Created **intelligent relationships** that:
- Connect competencies → units → lessons
- Link concepts → practical applications
- Bridge subject hubs bidirectionally
- Establish prerequisite progressions

This enables **serendipitous discovery** where exploring one resource surfaces related content.

   - Enrich any remaining competency pages

2. **Whakataukī Enrichment Sprint:**
   - Use the 20 identified lessons as a priority list
   - Focus on Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga lessons (already 100% cultural integration, adding whakataukī will make them exemplary)
   - Add whakataukī to Y7 Algebra lessons (will raise Math cultural integration from 34% → higher)

3. **GraphRAG Relationship Building:**
   - Aim for **100+ cross-curricular relationships** total
   - Focus on prerequisite chains (Y7 → Y8 → Y9 progressions)
   - Add more lesson → competency mappings

4. **Visual Pathway Explorer:**
   - Consider building a D3.js or Cytoscape.js visualization of the GraphRAG
   - Show "If you like this resource, you might also like..." recommendations
   - Make knowledge graph discoverable to teachers

5. **Beta Launch Execution:**
   - Send recruitment emails to 10-15 teachers (select 5 from responses)
   - Track engagement with PostHog
   - Monitor feedback submissions
   - Iterate based on Week 1 feedback
