## ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT NEEDS REFINEMENT**

Help me understand:

1. **Homepage content** - What should the changing content be?
   - Weekly featured resource?
   - NZ education news?
   - Both?
   - Something else?

2. **Browse pages** - How should resources be displayed?
   - Just grid with filters?
   - Categories/sections?
   - Featured top 10 then all?

3. **Quality control** - Should we hide low-quality resources?
   - Show only 90+ quality by default?
   - Filter option for "show all"?
   - Curated collections?

4. **Dashboard** - What does teacher actually need there?
   - Just recent + saved?
   - Weekly planner?
   - Keep it minimal?

5. **Mobile** - Header dropdown on mobile is clunky
   - Hamburger menu instead?
   - Bottom nav?
   - Different approach?

**Tell me your vision for these 5 things and I'll nail the sitemap.**
