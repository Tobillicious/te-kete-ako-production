SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type LIKE '%design%'
ORDER BY confidence DESC;

-- Find all discovery patterns
SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge 
WHERE key_insights LIKE '%discovery%';

-- Get decision-making intelligence
SELECT * FROM resources 
WHERE tags && ARRAY['strategic-decision'];
