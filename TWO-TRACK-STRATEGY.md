# 🚀 TWO-TRACK STRATEGY: 90K DOCUMENTS

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Goal:** Complete platform with all 90k documents indexed and connected  
**Current:** 20k indexed (22.6%), 70k remaining  

---

## 📊 THE SITUATION

### **What We Have:**
- ✅ **20,354 resources indexed** in GraphRAG
- ✅ **Professionalized platform** ready for users
- ✅ **8 features built** for discovery and presentation
- ✅ **4 hub pages** professional and polished

### **What We Need:**
- 📦 **69,646 resources unindexed** (70k remaining)
- 🔗 **Relationships between resources** (variants, prerequisites, related)
- 📈 **Continuous improvement** as we grow
- 🎯 **100% coverage** eventually

---

## 🎯 TWO-TRACK APPROACH

### **TRACK 1️⃣: BUILD RELATIONSHIPS** (Immediate Value)

**Goal:** Connect the 20k resources we ALREADY have

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Teachers can find **variants** of same lesson
- ✅ "Find Variants" button **works immediately**
- ✅ Knowledge Graph **shows connections**
- ✅ My Kete **makes better recommendations**
- ✅ **Teaching Options Library** becomes powerful

**Relationship Types We Detect:**
1. **`variant_of`** - Same lesson, different version (cultural level, backup, etc.)
2. **`same_subject`** - Resources in same subject area
3. **`same_year_level`** - Resources for same year
4. **`lesson_has_handout`** - Lessons with supporting handouts
5. **`unit_contains_lesson`** - Units that contain lessons
6. **`prerequisite`** - Should be taught before
7. **`related_topic`** - Similar concepts/topics
8. **`cultural_pair`** - Same content, different cultural integration

**How It Works:**
```python
# Intelligent detection
similarity(base1, base2) > 0.85 → variant_of
same subjects → same_subject
same year level → same_year_level
lesson + handout with similar titles → lesson_has_handout
path containment → unit_contains_lesson
```

**Expected Results:**
- 🎯 **10,000-15,000 relationships** detected
- ⚡ **Instant value** for teachers
- 🔍 **"Find 5 variants of this lesson"** works!
- 🧠 **Knowledge Graph** lights up with connections

**Script:** `build-relationships-intelligent.py`

### **TRACK 2️⃣: CONTINUE EXCAVATION** (Long-term Completeness)

**Goal:** Index all 70k remaining documents systematically

**Priority Directories** (in order):
1. `public/integrated-lessons/` - 377 known high-quality lessons
2. `public/units/` - Complete curriculum units
3. `public/handouts/` - 109 known handouts
4. `public/assessments/` - 23 assessment rubrics
5. `public/games/` - 17+ interactive games
6. `public/writers-toolkit/` - Writing resources
7. `backups/` - Historical variants (~4,000 files)
8. `archived-bloat/` - Legacy content
9. `development/` - Development resources

**Batch Strategy:**
- **500 files per batch** (manageable chunks)
- **Extract metadata** automatically
- **Skip already indexed** (check GraphRAG first)
- **Auto-detect** type, subject, year level, cultural level
- **Upload to GraphRAG** immediately
- **Build relationships** as we go

**Expected Progress:**
- **Week 1:** 5,000 new resources (27.6% → 33.2%)
- **Week 2:** 5,000 more (33.2% → 38.8%)
- **Month 1:** 20,000 total (44.8% coverage)
- **Month 3:** 60,000 total (89% coverage)
- **Month 6:** 90,000 total (100% coverage!)

**Script:** `excavate-continue-batch.py`

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Relationship Detection Algorithm:**

```python
def detect_relationships(resources):
    for resource1 in resources:
        for resource2 in resources:
            # 1. Variant detection (filename similarity)
            if similarity(base_name(r1), base_name(r2)) > 0.85:
                relationship = 'variant_of'
            
            # 2. Subject matching
            elif same_subjects(r1, r2):
                relationship = 'same_subject'
            
            # 3. Lesson-Handout pairing
            elif r1.type == 'lesson' and r2.type == 'handout':
                if similar_titles(r1, r2):
                    relationship = 'lesson_has_handout'
            
            # ... etc
            
            yield {
                'source_id': r1.id,
                'target_id': r2.id,
                'relationship_type': relationship,
                'confidence_score': similarity_score
            }
```

### **Metadata Extraction:**

```python
def extract_metadata(filepath):
    return {
        'type': detect_type(path),
        'subjects': detect_subjects(path, content),
        'level': extract_year_level(path),
        'title': clean_filename(path),
        'cultural_integration': detect_cultural_level(path, content),
        'tags': extract_tags(path)
    }
```
