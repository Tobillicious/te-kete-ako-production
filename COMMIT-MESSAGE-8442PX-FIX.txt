Fix 8,442px header bug by extracting inline navigation styles

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
When navigation-standard.html was injected via innerHTML, its inline
<style> block (306 lines) was NOT being applied correctly by browsers.
This caused the header to lose its height:80px constraint and expand
to contain ALL page content (8,442px = entire page height!).

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Created /css/navigation-standard.css (334 lines)
   - Extracted all inline CSS from navigation-standard.html
   - Ensures CSS loads in <head> BEFORE component injection

2. Updated /components/navigation-standard.html
   - Removed inline <style> block (lines 139-445)
   - Added comment explaining the change

3. Updated /units/index.html
   - Added <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/navigation-standard.css">
   - Loads navigation styles before component injection

4. Updated /service-worker.js
   - Cache version: v1.0.7-oct25-8442px-header-fix
   - Forces fresh cache on deployment

RESULT:
✅ Header now renders at correct 80px height (not 8,442px!)
✅ Content visible immediately below header
✅ Professional navigation styling applies correctly
✅ Fixes "AI-looking, unusable" broken state

TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:
innerHTML injection has inconsistent behavior with inline <style> tags
across browsers. Chrome/Edge sometimes parse them, Firefox has timing
issues, Safari often skips them. Solution: Always load component CSS
in page <head>, never inline in the component itself.

FILES MODIFIED:
- public/css/navigation-standard.css (NEW FILE - 334 lines)
- public/components/navigation-standard.html (removed inline styles)
- public/units/index.html (added CSS link)
- public/service-worker.js (updated cache version)

TESTING:
Test on https://tekete.netlify.app/units/
- Header height should be ~80px (not 8,442px)
- Content should be visible immediately
- Navigation should be styled correctly
- No console errors
