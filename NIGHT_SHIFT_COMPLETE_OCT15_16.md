## 💡 LEARNINGS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS

**What Worked Brilliantly:**
1. **Systematic batch transformations** - sed patterns at scale
2. **Real-time user collaboration** - parallel editing worked!
3. **MCP coordination** - prevented conflicts
4. **GraphRAG updates** - maintained collective memory
5. **Clear targets** - 300-page goal motivated excellence

**What to Improve:**
1. **More agents active** - need agent-5, agent-6 activated
2. **Earlier site audit** - should have happened first
3. **Hero page selection** - could have guided CSS priority
4. **Testing concurrent** - QA while building next time

**For Next Session:**
- Activate agents-5 and -6 early
- Start with hero page selection
- Then systematically perfect those
- Parallel: Site audit running
- Continuous: CSS polish on remaining
