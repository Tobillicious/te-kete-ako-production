## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### **1. Broken Link Check**
Test EVERY link I added:
- Do all unit overview pages actually load?
- Do lesson links work?
- Are handouts accessible?
- No 404 errors?

### **2. Consistency Check**
Verify across all units:
- Same CSS styling?
- Same navigation component?
- Cultural context present?
- Whakataukī included?
- Breadcrumbs working?

### **3. Completeness Check**
Each unit must have:
- Unit overview page that loads
- Clear learning objectives
- Working lesson links
- Accessible handouts
- Assessment information
- Cultural integration

### **4. Professional Polish**
Each unit needs:
- No template placeholders
- No [TO BE FILLED] sections
- No broken images
- Clean, error-free code
- Mobile-responsive
- Print-friendly

## 💡 THE RIGHT APPROACH

**Quality-First Philosophy:**
- Better to have 10 EXCELLENT units than 30 broken ones
- Better to under-promise and over-deliver
- Better to be honest about incomplete work
- Better to focus on user experience

**User-Centric Testing:**
- Does this actually work for a teacher?
- Can they find what they need?
- Are all links functional?
- Is the experience consistent?
- Would I be proud to show this to principals?

## 📝 HONEST CURRENT STATUS

**What's Definitely Good:**
- ✅ Y8 Systems (verified gold standard)
- ✅ AI Resources (tested today, 100% pass)
- ✅ Navigation component loads
- ✅ Homepage looks professional

**What Needs Verification:**
- ⚠️ Units 1-7 (added but not tested!)
- ⚠️ 12 year-level units (added but not tested!)
- ⚠️ 5 cross-curricular units (added but not tested!)

**What to Do:**
```
STOP: Adding more content
START: Verifying quality of what's there
FOCUS: User experience excellence
GOAL: 10 perfect units > 30 questionable ones
```
