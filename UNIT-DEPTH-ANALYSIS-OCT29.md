## 📊 **CURRENT UNIT DEPTH ASSESSMENT**

### Unit 1: Te Ao Māori - Cultural Identity & Knowledge Systems ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Strong cultural foundation (whakataukī in sidebar)
- ✅ Comprehensive curriculum alignment (Social Studies, Te Reo, Arts)
- ✅ Clear learning vision and competencies
- ✅ 5 linked lessons (full sequence)
- ✅ Good pedagogical approach (culturally grounded)

**Depth Gaps**:
- ⚠️ **Missing summative assessment details** - Says there's assessment but no rubric shown
- ⚠️ **No weekly breakdown** - Says "Weeks 1-2" but doesn't show day-by-day content
- ⚠️ **Limited community connections** - No guidance on inviting kaumātua, iwi partnerships
- ⚠️ **No student work examples** - Teachers can't visualize expected outcomes
- ⚠️ **Thin differentiation notes** - Says "Years 7-10" but minimal scaffolding detail

**Enrichment Opportunities** (HIGH VALUE):
1. **Add detailed summative assessment rubric** with exemplar descriptors
2. **Create weekly lesson-by-lesson breakdown** (what happens each day)
3. **Add "Community Connections" section** with practical guidance for iwi partnerships
4. **Include student work samples** (exemplar whakapapa projects, pepeha presentations)
5. **Expand differentiation** (Year 7 adaptations, Year 10 extensions, EAL support)

**Impact**: Would elevate from "good unit" to "exemplary, ready-to-use unit"

- ⚠️ **No rubric provided** - How are projects graded? What makes "excellent"?
- ⚠️ **Limited mātauranga Māori examples** - Unit ABOUT dual systems but thin on actual traditional knowledge
- ⚠️ **No scientist/kaitiaki partnership guidance** - Says "community" but no how-to
- ⚠️ **Weak connection between lessons** - Feel somewhat disconnected

**Enrichment Opportunities** (HIGH VALUE):
1. **Create detailed project scaffolding** (step-by-step planning template)
2. **Add comprehensive rubric** with cultural and scientific criteria
3. **Enrich with specific mātauranga examples**:
   - Māori astronomy (Matariki, navigation)

## 🎓 **USER PREFERENCE ALIGNMENT**

You said: **"Depth over breadth"** [[memory:5715027]]

**This analysis delivers**:
- Not adding NEW units (breadth)
- ENRICHING existing units (depth!)
- Making content "thoroughly enriched"
- Human-accessible teaching resources [[memory:10322983]]

**Perfect alignment with your values!** ✅

---

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED NEXT SESSION FOCUS**

### Option A: Deep Enrichment Sprint (5-7 hours)
**Focus**: Fix critical gaps (Units 3 & 4)  
**Outcome**: All units have complete, rigorous assessments  
**Value**: HIGH - makes content truly professional

### Option B: GraphRAG Update + Planning (2-3 hours)
**Focus**: Document session work, update knowledge system  
**Outcome**: Clean handoff to future agents/sessions  
**Value**: MEDIUM - organizational, not user-facing

### Option C: Launch Beta NOW, Enrich Based on Feedback
**Focus**: Ship current content, iterate with real teachers  
**Outcome**: Learn what ACTUALLY needs enrichment  
**Value**: PRACTICAL - user-driven priorities

**My Recommendation**: **Option A** - Critical enrichment sprint, THEN launch beta with confidence!
