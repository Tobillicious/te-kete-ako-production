### 1. **Manual Testing Required** (User to do - 10 mins)
```
Visit: http://localhost:8001/register-onboarding.html

Test Teacher Registration:
1. Fill Step 1 with password: TestPass123
2. Select "I'm a Teacher"
3. Search for school (e.g., "Auckland Grammar")
4. Select subjects + year levels
5. Skip cultural (optional) or fill it
6. Accept terms & create account

```

**Verify in Supabase:**
```sql
-- Check user created

-- Check rich data captured
SELECT school_name, subjects_taught, year_levels_taught 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'your.test@email.com';
```

    return;
  }
  
  await supabase
    .from('user_saved_resources')
    .insert({
      user_id: user.id,
      resource_id: resourceId,
      resource_title: resourceTitle,
      saved_at: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
  showNotification('✅ Saved to My Kete!');
}

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Critical Paths to Test:
- [ ] Register as Teacher (new email)
- [ ] School search works (finds schools)
- [ ] Profile created in database
- [ ] Login with new account
- [ ] Logout works
- [ ] Password reset flow (if email configured)
- [ ] Register as Student (different flow)

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] School not found → Add custom school
- [ ] Skip cultural context → Works fine
