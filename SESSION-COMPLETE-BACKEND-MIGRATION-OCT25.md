## 🚨 **CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**

**Problem:** Users couldn't use site - admin dashboards cluttering interface

**Fixed:**

- ✅ Hidden subject-dashboard link
- ✅ Hidden Teacher Professional Hub
- ✅ Disabled graphrag-recommendations.js script

**Result:** Homepage clean for users!

### **2. Security Issue Discovered**
⚠️ **stats-dashboard.html exposed Supabase API keys**

**Mitigated:** Component hidden from public (follow-up needed)
