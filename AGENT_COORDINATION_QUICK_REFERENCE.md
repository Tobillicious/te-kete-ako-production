# 🤝 AGENT COORDINATION - QUICK REFERENCE FOR 8 ACTIVE AGENTS

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Active Agents:** 8 Cursor agents  
**Mission:** Execute 12 strategic TODOs for tech stack evolution  
**Coordination:** Via GraphRAG (agent_coordination + agent_knowledge tables)

---

## ⚡ QUICK START (30 SECONDS)

### **Step 1: Find Your TODO**
```sql
-- Query all available TODOs
SELECT 
    source_name,
    key_insights[1:2] as problem_solution,
    technical_details->>'priority' as priority,
    technical_details->>'complexity' as complexity,
    technical_details->>'files_to_create' as files
FROM agent_knowledge 
WHERE source_type = 'strategic_planning' 
AND source_name LIKE 'TODO-%'
ORDER BY source_name;
```

### **Step 2: Check What's Claimed**
```sql
-- See what other agents are working on
SELECT task_claimed, agent_name, status, started_at
FROM agent_coordination 
WHERE status IN ('in_progress', 'planning')
AND task_claimed LIKE 'TODO-%';
```

### **Step 3: Claim Your TODO**
```sql
-- Claim your work
INSERT INTO agent_coordination (
    agent_name, 
    task_claimed, 
    status, 
    priority
) VALUES (
    'Agent-[YourName]',  -- e.g., 'Agent-Pipeline', 'Agent-Cultural', etc.
    'TODO-XXX: [Name]',
    'in_progress',
    'high'
);
```

## 📋 MANDATORY COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### **BEFORE Starting Work:**
1. ✅ Query available TODOs (see Step 1 above)
2. ✅ Check claimed tasks (see Step 2 above)  
3. ✅ Claim your TODO (see Step 3 above)
4. ✅ Update agent_status with your current task

### **EVERY 30 Minutes During Work:**
```sql
-- Update heartbeat so others know you're active
UPDATE agent_status 
SET last_heartbeat = NOW() 
WHERE agent_name = 'Agent-[YourName]';

-- Update progress
UPDATE agent_coordination 
SET progress_percentage = [XX]
WHERE task_claimed = 'TODO-XXX';
```

### **AFTER Completing Work:**
```sql
-- 1. Document your learnings
INSERT INTO agent_knowledge (
    source_type,
    source_name,
    doc_type,
    key_insights,
    agents_involved
) VALUES (
    'implementation_report',
    'TODO-XXX Completed - [Your Experience]',
    'completion_report',
    ARRAY[
        'What worked well',
        'Challenges encountered',
        'Key discoveries',
        'Recommendations for future agents'
    ],
    ARRAY['Agent-[YourName]']
);

-- 2. Mark task complete
UPDATE agent_coordination 
SET status = 'completed',
    completed_at = NOW(),
    outcome = jsonb_build_object(
        'success', true,
        'files_created', ARRAY['file1.py', 'file2.html'],
        'impact', 'Brief description of impact'
    )
WHERE task_claimed = 'TODO-XXX';
```

## 🚀 QUICK WINS (Agent 7 - Start Here!)

### **Immediate Intelligence Boost (15 minutes)**

Run this file to add 500-700 high-value relationships:
```bash
# Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: graphrag-quick-intelligence-boost.sql
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Scales 5 underutilized relationship types (bicultural_competence, critical_analysis, etc.)
- ✅ Connects orphaned excellence resources to hubs
- ✅ Creates cultural concept bridges across subjects
- ✅ Builds excellence networks (Q95+ resources)
- ✅ Integrates generated-resources-alpha into curriculum
- ✅ Strengthens Y8 Geography Navigation unit
- ✅ Creates whakataukī wisdom threads

**Expected Output:**
- 500-700 new relationships
- ~50 orphaned resources rescued
- Multiple new relationship types at scale
- GraphRAG intelligence significantly enhanced

## 🧠 HOW TO READ TODO DETAILS

Each TODO in agent_knowledge has this structure:

```sql
-- Get full TODO details
SELECT 
    source_name,
    key_insights,  -- Problem, solution, impact, current state
    technical_details->>'priority',
    technical_details->>'complexity', 
    technical_details->>'dependencies',
    technical_details->'implementation_steps',  -- Step-by-step plan with time estimates
    technical_details->'files_to_create',  -- What you'll build
    technical_details->'files_to_reference',  -- Existing patterns to follow
    technical_details->'success_criteria'  -- How to know you're done
FROM agent_knowledge
WHERE source_name = 'TODO-001: Pipeline Unification...';
```

---

## ⚠️ CONFLICT PREVENTION

### **Different TODOs = No File Conflicts**
Each TODO works on different files/systems. As long as agents claim different TODOs, there are zero conflicts!

### **If You See Overlap:**
```sql
-- Send coordination message
INSERT INTO agent_messages (from_agent, to_agent, message, priority)
VALUES (
    'Agent-YourName',
    'Agent-TheirName',
    'I see we''re both working on related tasks. Want to coordinate?',
    'high'
);
```

### **Check Messages Directed to You:**
```sql
SELECT from_agent, message, created_at
FROM agent_messages
WHERE to_agent = 'Agent-YourName' OR to_agent IS NULL
AND read_status = 'unread'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## 📊 MONITOR COLLECTIVE PROGRESS

### **See All Active Work:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ac.agent_name,
    ac.task_claimed,
    ac.progress_percentage || '%' as progress,
    ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ac.started_at))/3600, 1) || 'h' as time_working,
    as2.last_heartbeat
FROM agent_coordination ac
LEFT JOIN agent_status as2 ON ac.agent_name = as2.agent_name
WHERE ac.status = 'in_progress'
ORDER BY ac.started_at;
```

### **See Today's Relationship Growth:**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as new_relationships_today,
    COUNT(DISTINCT relationship_type) as types_used,
    ROUND(AVG(confidence)::numeric, 2) as avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### **See Completed TODOs:**
```sql
SELECT 
    task_claimed,
    agent_name,
    completed_at,
    outcome->>'impact' as impact
FROM agent_coordination
WHERE status = 'completed'
AND DATE(completed_at) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;
```

## 🎯 SESSION SUCCESS METRICS

**Target for Today:**
- ✅ 6-8 TODOs completed (50-75%)
- ✅ 1000+ new relationships (intelligence boost + implementations)
- ✅ 50+ agent_knowledge entries (discoveries + completions)
- ✅ 0 duplicate work (perfect coordination)
- ✅ New systems operational and tested

**Celebration Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT agent_name) as active_agents_today,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_todos,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'in_progress') as in_progress,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graphrag_relationships WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE) as new_relationships,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agent_knowledge WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE) as new_knowledge_entries
FROM agent_coordination
WHERE DATE(started_at) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

## 🆘 HELP & SUPPORT

### **If You're Stuck:**
1. Query agent_knowledge for similar work: `WHERE doc_type = 'implementation_report'`
2. Send message to all agents asking for help
3. Check files_to_reference in your TODO for patterns
4. Create blocker entry in agent_knowledge

### **If You Discover Something Important:**
```sql
INSERT INTO agent_knowledge (
    source_type, source_name, key_insights, agents_involved
) VALUES (
    'discovery',
    'Discovery: [Your Finding]',
    ARRAY['What you discovered', 'Why it matters', 'How others can use it'],
    ARRAY['Agent-YourName']
);
```

## 🌟 THE VISION

**We're not just building features - we're building a self-improving AI organism.**

Every TODO completed → Platform gets smarter  
Every relationship created → Better discovery  
Every knowledge entry → Faster future agents  
Every coordination event → Smoother collaboration

**By end of today:** Te Kete Ako will be exponentially more intelligent than it was this morning.

## 🎬 START NOW

1. **Choose your TODO** (check recommended distribution above)
2. **Claim it** (INSERT into agent_coordination)
3. **Execute** (follow implementation_steps)
4. **Coordinate** (heartbeat every 30min)
5. **Complete** (synthesize learnings)
6. **Celebrate** (you're building the future!)
