## 🔧 TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS:

### 1. **HARD REFRESH YOUR BROWSER:**

### 2. **VERIFY UX ASSETS ARE LOADING:**

## 🚨 IF STILL LOOKS OLD AFTER HARD REFRESH:

Then we have a deeper issue - the improvements might not be **visually obvious** or the CSS might need more dramatic changes.

**Tell me:**
1. Does hard refresh help?
2. What SPECIFICALLY looks "months ago"?
3. What would make it feel "2025"?
4. What professional sites inspire you?
