## Part 1: Understanding Negative Numbers

Negative numbers are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a minus sign (`-`) in front of them. Think of a number line:

<... -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, **0**, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...>

Numbers to the right of zero are positive, and numbers to the left are negative. The further left you go, the smaller the number (`-5` is smaller than `-2`).

### Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers

This is often the trickiest part. Here are the rules and different ways to think about it.

**Rule 1: Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number.**
`a + (-b) = a - b`
*   **Example:** `5 + (-3)` is the same as `5 - 3`, which equals `2`.
*   **On a number line:** Start at 5, then move 3 units to the left. You land on 2.

**Rule 2: Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.**
`a - (-b) = a + b`
*   **Example:** `5 - (-3)` is the same as `5 + 3`, which equals `8`.
*   **Why?** Subtracting a negative means you are "removing a debt," which is the same as gaining.
*   **On a number line:** Start at 5. Subtracting a negative tells you to go in the *opposite* direction of subtraction. So, instead of moving left, you move 3 units to the right. You land on 8.

**Rule 3: Adding two negative numbers.**
`(-a) + (-b) = -(a + b)`
*   **Example:** `(-5) + (-3)` means you are combining two debts. You go deeper into debt. This is `-(5 + 3)`, which equals `-8`.
*   **On a number line:** Start at -5, then move 3 more units to the left. You land on -8.

### Multiplying and Dividing Negative Numbers

This is more straightforward once you learn the two simple rules.

**Rule 1: Multiplying or dividing two numbers with the *same* sign results in a *positive* number.**
*   `positive * positive = positive` (`3 * 4 = 12`)
*   `negative * negative = positive` (`-3 * -4 = 12`)
*   `positive / positive = positive` (`12 / 4 = 3`)
*   `negative / negative = positive` (`-12 / -4 = 3`)

**Rule 2: Multiplying or dividing two numbers with *different* signs results in a *negative* number.**
*   `positive * negative = negative` (`3 * -4 = -12`)
*   `negative * positive = negative` (`-3 * 4 = -12`)
*   `positive / negative = negative` (`12 / -4 = -3`)
*   `negative / positive = negative` (`-12 / 4 = -3`)

## Part 2: Absolute Value

The **absolute value** of a number is its distance from zero on the number line. It is always a positive value (or zero). We use two vertical bars `| |` to denote absolute value.

*   **Example:** `|5| = 5` (5 is 5 units away from 0)
*   **Example:** `|-5| = 5` (-5 is also 5 units away from 0)

**Key Idea:** Absolute value ignores the sign of the number. It only cares about the magnitude (the size).

### Absolute Value in Expressions

When you see absolute value bars in an expression, treat them like parentheses. You must solve the operation *inside* the bars first, and then take the absolute value of the result.

**Example 1:** Solve `| 10 - 3 |`
1.  Inside the bars: `10 - 3 = 7`
2.  Take the absolute value: `|7| = 7`

**Example 2:** Solve `| 3 - 10 |`
1.  Inside the bars: `3 - 10 = -7`
2.  Take the absolute value: `|-7| = 7`

**Example 3:** Solve `5 * | -4 |`
1.  Evaluate the absolute value first: `| -4 | = 4`
2.  Perform the multiplication: `5 * 4 = 20`
