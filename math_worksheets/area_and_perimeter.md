## Introduction

**Perimeter** is the total distance around the outside of a 2D shape. You calculate it by adding the lengths of all the sides together. The units are units of length (e.g., cm, m).

**Area** is the amount of space inside a 2D shape. The formula for area depends on the shape. The units are square units (e.g., cm², m²).

## Squares

A square has four equal sides. Let the side length be `s`.

*   **Perimeter of a Square:** `P = 4s`
*   **Area of a Square:** `A = s * s = s²`

**Example:** A square with a side length of 5 cm.
*   **Perimeter:** `P = 4 * 5 cm = 20 cm`
*   **Area:** `A = 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cm²`

## Rectangles

A rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides being equal in length. Let the length be `l` and the width be `w`.

*   **Perimeter of a Rectangle:** `P = 2l + 2w` or `P = 2(l + w)`
*   **Area of a Rectangle:** `A = l * w`

**Example:** A rectangle with a length of 8 cm and a width of 3 cm.
*   **Perimeter:** `P = 2(8 cm + 3 cm) = 2(11 cm) = 22 cm`
*   **Area:** `A = 8 cm * 3 cm = 24 cm²`

## Triangles

A triangle has three sides. For the area, we need the `base` (b) and the `height` (h). The height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

*   **Perimeter of a Triangle:** `P = a + b + c` (where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides)
*   **Area of a Triangle:** `A = (1/2) * b * h`

**Example:** A triangle with side lengths 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm. The base is 6 cm and the height is 4.5 cm (this can vary depending on which side is the base).
*   **Perimeter:** `P = 5 cm + 6 cm + 7 cm = 18 cm`
*   **Area:** `A = (1/2) * 6 cm * 4.5 cm = 3 cm * 4.5 cm = 13.5 cm²`

## Answer Key

1.  **Square:** Side length = 7 m
    *   Perimeter: `4 * 7 = 28 m`
    *   Area: `7 * 7 = 49 m²`
2.  **Rectangle:** Length = 10 cm, Width = 4 cm
    *   Perimeter: `2(10 + 4) = 2(14) = 28 cm`
    *   Area: `10 * 4 = 40 cm²`
3.  **Square:** Side length = 3.5 cm
    *   Perimeter: `4 * 3.5 = 14 cm`
    *   Area: `3.5 * 3.5 = 12.25 cm²`
4.  **Rectangle:** Length = 12 m, Width = 12 m
    *   Perimeter: `2(12 + 12) = 2(24) = 48 m`
    *   Area: `12 * 12 = 144 m²`
5.  **Triangle:** Sides = 8 cm, 10 cm, 12 cm. The height to the 10 cm base is 7.5 cm.
    *   Perimeter: `8 + 10 + 12 = 30 cm`
    *   Area: `(1/2) * 10 * 7.5 = 5 * 7.5 = 37.5 cm²`
