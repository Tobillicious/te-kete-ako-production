## Introduction

A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. These equations describe a straight line when graphed. The goal of solving a linear equation is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. The main strategy is to isolate the variable (get it by itself) on one side of the equation.

### The Golden Rule of Algebra

Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side. This keeps the equation balanced.

## Worked Examples

### One-Step Equations

**Example 1:** Solve `x + 5 = 12`

1.  To isolate `x`, we need to get rid of the `+ 5`.
2.  The opposite of adding 5 is subtracting 5.
3.  Subtract 5 from both sides: `x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5`
4.  Simplify: `x = 7`
5.  **Answer:** `x = 7`

**Example 2:** Solve `3y = 15`

1.  To isolate `y`, we need to get rid of the `* 3`.
2.  The opposite of multiplying by 3 is dividing by 3.
3.  Divide both sides by 3: `3y / 3 = 15 / 3`
4.  Simplify: `y = 5`
5.  **Answer:** `y = 5`

### Two-Step Equations

**Example 3:** Solve `2a - 4 = 10`

1.  First, get rid of the constant term (`- 4`). Add 4 to both sides:
    `2a - 4 + 4 = 10 + 4`
    `2a = 14`
2.  Now, get rid of the coefficient (`2`). Divide both sides by 2:
    `2a / 2 = 14 / 2`
    `a = 7`
3.  **Answer:** `a = 7`

### Equations with Variables on Both Sides

**Example 4:** Solve `5x - 2 = 3x + 6`

1.  Get all the `x` terms on one side. Subtract `3x` from both sides:
    `5x - 3x - 2 = 3x - 3x + 6`
    `2x - 2 = 6`
2.  Now it's a two-step equation. Add 2 to both sides:
    `2x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2`
    `2x = 8`
3.  Divide by 2:
    `2x / 2 = 8 / 2`
    `x = 4`
4.  **Answer:** `x = 4`

## Practice Problems

Solve for the variable in each equation.

1.  `a + 7 = 15`
2.  `b - 3 = 10`
3.  `5c = 30`
4.  `d / 4 = 5`
5.  `2x + 3 = 13`
6.  `3y - 4 = 11`
7.  `z / 2 + 1 = 7`
8.  `4a + 5 = 2a + 11`
9.  `6b - 2 = 4b + 8`
10. `3(c + 2) = 15`

## Answer Key

1.  `a = 8`
2.  `b = 13`
3.  `c = 6`
4.  `d = 20`
5.  `2x = 10` -> `x = 5`
6.  `3y = 15` -> `y = 5`
7.  `z / 2 = 6` -> `z = 12`
8.  `2a = 6` -> `a = 3`
9.  `2b = 10` -> `b = 5`
10. `3c + 6 = 15` -> `3c = 9` -> `c = 3`
