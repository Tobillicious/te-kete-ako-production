## Introduction

In mathematics, an operation is an action such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. When you have a mathematical expression with more than one operation, you need to follow a specific order to get the correct answer. This is called the **Order of Operations**.

We can remember the order using the acronyms **PEMDAS** or **BODMAS**.

### PEMDAS

*   **P**arentheses
*   **E**xponents
*   **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
*   **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

### BODMAS

*   **B**rackets
*   **O**rders (powers and square roots)
*   **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (from left to right)
*   **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

Both acronyms mean the same thing. The key is to remember that Multiplication/Division and Addition/Subtraction are done from left to right.

## Worked Examples

**Example 1:** Solve `3 + 5 * 2`

1.  **Multiplication first:** `5 * 2 = 10`
2.  **Then Addition:** `3 + 10 = 13`
3.  **Answer:** `13`

**Example 2:** Solve `(3 + 5) * 2`

1.  **Parentheses first:** `3 + 5 = 8`
2.  **Then Multiplication:** `8 * 2 = 16`
3.  **Answer:** `16`

**Example 3:** Solve `10 - 6 / 2`

1.  **Division first:** `6 / 2 = 3`
2.  **Then Subtraction:** `10 - 3 = 7`
3.  **Answer:** `7`

**Example 4:** Solve `20 / 10 * 2`

1.  **Division and Multiplication from left to right.**
2.  **First, the division:** `20 / 10 = 2`
3.  **Then, the multiplication:** `2 * 2 = 4`
4.  **Answer:** `4`

## Answer Key

1.  `10 + 2 * 5` = `10 + 10` = `20`
2.  `15 - 3 * 4` = `15 - 12` = `3`
3.  `(10 + 2) * 5` = `12 * 5` = `60`
4.  `20 / 5 + 3` = `4 + 3` = `7`
5.  `8 + 12 / 4` = `8 + 3` = `11`
6.  `24 / (6 + 2)` = `24 / 8` = `3`
7.  `5 * 3 + 4 * 2` = `15 + 8` = `23`
8.  `18 - 6 / 2 + 5` = `18 - 3 + 5` = `15 + 5` = `20`
9.  `(5 + 3) * (4 - 2)` = `8 * 2` = `16`
10. `36 / 3 * 4 - 2` = `12 * 4 - 2` = `48 - 2` = `46`
