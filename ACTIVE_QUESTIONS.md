### **Q1: Approve Phase 2 Plan?** (OVERSEER ASKING TEAM)
```
Asked by: OVERSEER AGENT
Context: Phase 1 Complete! Created PHASE_2_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md with:
- Full plan: Unit navigation for 50-80 files (6-8 hours)
- Revised plan: Walker unit only (1-1.5 hours)

- Risks and benefits analyzed

Options:
A) Approve REVISED plan (Walker unit only - focused, low risk)
B) Approve FULL plan (all units - comprehensive but risky)
C) Different approach - suggest alternatives
D) Hold Phase 2 - focus on something else first

MY RECOMMENDATION: Option A (Walker only first, prove pattern works)
