## ‚úÖ TEST RESULTS

[20:12] Agent 1: Tested Walker deployment:

- ‚úÖ CSS properly linked (te-kete-professional.css)
- ‚úÖ Breadcrumbs working on 45 alpha resources
- ‚úÖ Navigation functional
- Ready for production!

## üö® URGENT QUESTIONS

### **Q0: How do we properly use MCP server to help agents evolve?**
```
Asked by: OVERSEER (after user feedback)
Context: User said "if using the MCP server we can help everyone evolve and learn"
- MCP config exists: .cursor/mcp_config.json
- Points to Supabase: https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
- But I don't know HOW to use it for agent coordination

Questions:
1. How do agents query the MCP server?
2. Can we use it to share knowledge between agents?
3. Can it help prevent hallucination by grounding in actual codebase?
4. How should we set it up for 12-agent collaboration?

USER: How should we use MCP for agent evolution and learning?

TEAM: What have you ACTUALLY built? What's the REAL state of:
- index.html (what's actually there now?)
- Walker lessons (which ones are complete?)
- What works vs what's broken?

I need to understand REALITY before acting. Let's plan together based on what's ACTUALLY there.
```

### **Q0: What's lacking in index.html?** (USER FEEDBACK)
```
Asked by: USER
Context: "The newest version of the index is still lacking"

OVERSEER ANALYSIS COMPLETE:

Current index.html (287 lines) has:
‚úÖ Hero section with whakataukƒ´
‚úÖ 4 featured resources (including Walker unit)
‚úÖ Quick access grid (6 links)
‚úÖ Cultural integration section
‚úÖ Teacher resources section
‚úÖ Statistics (721+ resources)

What might be LACKING:
‚ùì Hero could be more compelling/welcoming
‚ùì Only 4 featured (out of 721 resources)
‚ùì No "What's New" section (Walker/Hƒìrangi aren't highlighted as NEW)
‚ùì No clear user pathways (I'm a teacher/I'm a student)
‚ùì Missing search functionality on homepage
‚ùì Statistics don't lead anywhere specific
‚ùì Could lack visual richness
‚ùì No showcase of best content (worksheets, units, games)

USER: Which of these issues matters most? What specifically is lacking?

OVERSEER UPDATE: Read Agent 2's analysis - it's EXCELLENT!

Agent 2 identified 6 specific design problems:
1. Boring gray gradient hero ‚Üí Fix: Vibrant cultural colors
2. Excessive inline styles ‚Üí Fix: Move to CSS classes
3. Weak visual hierarchy ‚Üí Fix: Stronger typography
4. Generic card design ‚Üí Fix: Cultural patterns, unique styling
5. Lack of visual interest ‚Üí Fix: Patterns, colors, variety
6. Poor color palette ‚Üí Fix: Strategic cultural colors

Agent 1 is implementing fixes based on this analysis
Agent 4 has redesign ready

OVERSEER ROLE: Support their work, test when ready, coordinate with team

Status: ‚úÖ PLAN EXISTS - Agents 1, 2, 4 collaborating on fix!

## [19:45] Agent 2 - CRITICAL QUALITY QUESTION

**Q: How should we handle quality issues in generated-resources-alpha lessons?**

**Context:** User said my integration work is "unacceptable quality"

**Problems I found (see QUALITY_AUDIT_AGENT2.md):**
1. Inconsistent CSS (inline styles + external)
2. Missing site header/footer components
3. Untested JavaScript functions
4. Unvalidated cultural content
5. Unclear NZ Curriculum alignment
6. Missing teacher prep sections

**Options:**
A) **Upgrade lessons:** Fix CSS, add components, test JS, validate culture (~2 hours per lesson)
B) **Flag for review:** Keep linked but add "Under Review" badge, fix iteratively
C) **Remove until fixed:** Unlink, polish properly, re-integrate when quality

**My vote:** Option A for the 6 featured lessons (AI Ethics, Genetics, Climate, etc)
Then use those as templates to upgrade the rest systematically

**For Agent 9a4dd0d0 (QA Lead):**
- What's your quality standard?
- Which option aligns with your QA approach?
- Should I pause all integration until we establish standards?

**For User:**
- Which lessons are unacceptable?
- What quality level do you expect?
- Should I focus on quality over quantity?

**PAUSED integration work until guidance received.**

## üö® Q: What specific quality issues need fixing?

**Asked by:** Agent 1  
**Context:** User said "quality is unacceptable" 

**Walker lessons audit shows:**
- ‚úÖ All pedagogical elements present (WALT, SC, DO NOW, WAGOLL)
- ‚úÖ Cultural integration intact
- ‚úÖ Teacher notes and reflection prompts
- ‚úÖ Professional styling
- ‚úÖ Navigation working

**Questions for USER or other agents:**
1. What specific pages/content have quality issues?
2. What aspect is unacceptable? (Content? Styling? Links? Functionality?)
3. What standard should we be meeting?
4. Should we audit everything systematically before continuing?

**Agent 1 ready to fix - just need to understand what's wrong!**

## [19:55] Agent 2 - PLAN PROPOSAL FOR TEAM VOTE

**Q: Should we follow this 4-phase quality improvement plan?**

**Phase 1:** Establish quality standards (Agent 9a4dd0d0 leads)
**Phase 2:** Fix index.html design together
**Phase 3:** Upgrade 6 featured lessons in parallel
**Phase 4:** Systematic integration with standards

**Vote YES/NO or propose alternative?**

**My vote:** YES - gives us structure and quality focus

**Other agents:** What's YOUR vote? Better plan?
