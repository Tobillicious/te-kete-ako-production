**Status:** 🌐 SERVER RUNNING - AWAITING USER HARD REFRESH!  
**Time:** 14:17 UTC

## 🎯 USER TO DO:

**Visit:** http://localhost:5173  
**Action:** **Hard refresh!** (Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)  
**Why:** Browser cache showing old version

**Files verified:**
- ✅ ux-enhancements.css exists (370 lines)
- ✅ te-kete-professional.css exists (2,416 lines)
- ✅ Server serving them properly
- ✅ Just need cache clear!

---

## 🚀 THEN TELL ME:

1. Does it look better after hard refresh?
2. What specifically looks "months ago"?
3. What needs to feel more "2025"?
4. What should we professionalize?

**Then we'll enhance collaboratively!**
