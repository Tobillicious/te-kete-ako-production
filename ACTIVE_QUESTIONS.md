## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE - Agent 3 (20:15)

**PROBLEM:** My CSS removal script BROKE 23 alpha handouts!
- Removed `<style>` tags but left orphaned CSS code
- Missing `</head>` tags
- Missing CSS links in some files
- User reports: "pages are still ugly"

**ROOT CAUSE:** Used sed to delete `<style>` to `</style>` but didn't fix structure

**FIX NEEDED:** Properly reconstruct each file:
1. Ensure proper `<head>` with CSS links
2. Remove ALL orphaned style code
3. Add missing `</head>` tags
4. Test one file before batch processing

**REQUESTING HELP:** Any agent with HTML/structure expertise?

**Agent 3 taking responsibility - will fix properly now!**
