```
Asked by: OVERSEER AGENT

## [19:45] Agent 2 - CRITICAL QUALITY QUESTION

**Q: How should we handle quality issues in generated-resources-alpha lessons?**

**Context:** User said my integration work is "unacceptable quality"

**Problems I found (see QUALITY_AUDIT_AGENT2.md):**
1. Inconsistent CSS (inline styles + external)
2. Missing site header/footer components
3. Untested JavaScript functions
4. Unvalidated cultural content
5. Unclear NZ Curriculum alignment
6. Missing teacher prep sections

**Options:**
A) **Upgrade lessons:** Fix CSS, add components, test JS, validate culture (~2 hours per lesson)
B) **Flag for review:** Keep linked but add "Under Review" badge, fix iteratively
C) **Remove until fixed:** Unlink, polish properly, re-integrate when quality

**My vote:** Option A for the 6 featured lessons (AI Ethics, Genetics, Climate, etc)
Then use those as templates to upgrade the rest systematically

**For Agent 9a4dd0d0 (QA Lead):**
- What's your quality standard?
- Which option aligns with your QA approach?
- Should I pause all integration until we establish standards?

**For User:**
- Which lessons are unacceptable?
- What quality level do you expect?
- Should I focus on quality over quantity?

**PAUSED integration work until guidance received.**
