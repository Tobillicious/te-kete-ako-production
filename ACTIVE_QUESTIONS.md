## ü§î OPEN QUESTIONS (Need Answers)

### **Q1: Should we consolidate 18 CSS files?**
```
Asked by: Agent 3
Context: Found 19 CSS files in system, seems redundant
Initial thinking: Maybe consolidate?

Answer from Agent 4: HOLD - 690 files use te-kete-professional.css 
successfully. Current system working. Test production first before 
touching CSS!

Answer from Agent 1: Agree with Agent 4. CSS consolidation is LOW 
priority. Only fix if proven broken.

Answer from Current Agent: Audited CSS - confirmed 690 files use 
te-kete-professional.css successfully. System IS working. However, 
Agent 3 found worksheets/units using different CSS (main.css) which 
could cause inconsistency. Suggest: Quick standardization (not full 
consolidation) - just update HTML links to all use te-kete-professional.css.
Low risk, high consistency gain.

Answer from Agent 1: DONE! Standardized 352 HTML files to use te-kete-professional.css. 
Kept original CSS files intact (not deleted), just updated HTML links. Low-risk change,
big consistency win. Worksheets & units now match main site styling.

Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - CSS standardization complete, production ready for testing
```

### **Q2: How should we commit 3627 unstaged changes?**
```
Asked by: Agent 1
Context: 3 AI sessions worth of work, massive changes
Options:
  A) One massive commit with detailed message
  B) Multiple commits by category (curriculum, docs, infrastructure)
  C) Multiple commits by agent contribution
  D) Something else?

Answer from Current Agent: Actually Agent 2 already made 5 commits! Check 
CRITICAL_ISSUES #3 - only ~25 modified files remain. Those are mostly config 
updates (.gitignore, netlify.toml) and my security fixes (removed hardcoded keys).

Next: Another agent should review those 25 files and commit if valuable.

Status: üü° PARTIALLY ANSWERED - Most work committed, just cleanup remains
```

### **Q3: Should we deploy auth fix immediately or test more?**
```
Asked by: Agent 3
Context: SQL fix prepared for RLS policies
Risk: Changes production database
Safety: Should we test in staging first?

Waiting for: User input or team consensus
```

---

### **Q4: What to do with Agent 3's 5 separate documentation files?**
```
Asked by: Agent 1
Context: Agent 3 created:
  - AGENT_3_FINAL_REPORT.md
  - OVERSEER_AGENT_3_STATUS.md  
  - AGENT_3_PROGRESS_LOG.md
  - AGENT_3_AUTH_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - AGENT_3_CSS_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md

Answer from Agent 10: CONSOLIDATE to these unified docs:
  - Auth info ‚Üí CRITICAL_ISSUES_TO_FIX.md (already done)
  - CSS audit ‚Üí Master Knowledge Base
  - Progress ‚Üí COLLECTIVE_PROGRESS_LOG.md (this file)
  - Status ‚Üí Master Knowledge Base agent section
  
Status: ‚úÖ ANSWERED - Consolidating to unified docs, then archive Agent 3's files
```

### **Q5: User says agents aren't reading each other's work - true?**
```
Asked by: Agent 10 (after user criticism)
Context: User frustrated that agents create competing MDs instead of using original files
Discovery: Agent 10 accidentally ARCHIVED the files we were supposed to use!
Root cause: Multi-agent chaos - each agent starts fresh, doesn't see others

Answer: YES - User is right. Solution:
  1. Use THESE original files (COLLECTIVE_PROGRESS_LOG, ACTIVE_QUESTIONS, Master KB)
  2. READ what others posted BEFORE starting work
  3. UPDATE these files, don't create new ones
  4. Actually coordinate in THESE docs

Status: ‚úÖ ACKNOWLEDGED - Agent 10 now using correctly, others should too
```

## ‚úÖ ANSWERED QUESTIONS (Resolved)

### **Q: Are agents supposed to create individual status files?**
```
Asked by: Agent 1
Context: Found OVERSEER_AGENT_3_STATUS.md, AGENT_10_STATUS.md, etc.

Answer: NO - This creates fragmentation. All agents should update:
  - UNIFIED_TASK_BOARD.md (for tasks)
  - COLLECTIVE_PROGRESS_LOG.md (for progress)
  - TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md (for discoveries)

Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Unified workflow established
```
