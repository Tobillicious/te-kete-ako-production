   - The 451-connection pathway hub recommended in GraphRAG report
   - Features three major integration pathways:
     - 🌍 Climate Science ↔ Statistical Analysis (88 connections)
     - 🧬 Genetics ↔ Probability & Statistics (35 connections)
     - ⚡ Physics ↔ Algebraic Equations (71 connections)
   - Each pathway includes:
     - Authentic learning connections
     - Science and Math learning outcomes
     - Te Ao Māori cultural integration
     - Ready-to-use resource links
   - Implementation guide for teachers
   - Direct links to subject hubs

3. **`/public/index.html`** - Homepage Enhanced
   - Added TWO new discovery tools to GraphRAG Intelligence section:
     - 🔗 Cross-Subject Discovery (with "NEW!" badge)
     - 🔬📊 Science × Math Integration (with "NEW!" badge)
   - Both cards show real statistics from GraphRAG analysis
   - Positioned prominently in Discovery Tools section
