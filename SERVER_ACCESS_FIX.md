# 🚀 SERVER IS RUNNING - ACCESS IT HERE!

## ✅ **CORRECT URL:**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

**NOT** http://localhost:3000 (that's not running)

---

## 🔍 **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**

You have a **Vite server** already running on port **5173** (Process ID: 19655).

The Python server we tried to start on port 3000 either:
- Didn't start properly from the background command
- OR was overridden by the existing Vite server

---

## ✅ **TRY THESE URLS:**

1. **http://localhost:5173** ← Main Vite dev server
2. **http://localhost:5173/index.html** ← Direct to homepage

---

## 🧪 **IF YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT:**

### Option 1: Check if Vite is truly running
Open your browser and try:
- http://localhost:5173

### Option 2: Kill and restart the server
```bash
# Kill existing server
kill 19655

# Start fresh
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Use Python server instead
```bash
# Kill Vite
kill 19655

# Start Python from project root (not /public)
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8080/public/index.html

## 🎨 **WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:**

Once you access the correct URL, you'll see:
- ✅ Te Kete Ako homepage
- ✅ Green gradient hero section
- ✅ Platform statistics
- ✅ Professional navigation
- ✅ All your content

**Try http://localhost:5173 RIGHT NOW and let me know what you see!** 🚀
