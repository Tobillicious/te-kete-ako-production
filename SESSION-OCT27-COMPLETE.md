2. **Test Early, Test Often:** Browser testing caught issues that code review missed

3. **Content Quality Matters:** Removing 1,300 lines of duplicate/placeholder content made the site cleaner than adding new features

4. **Structure Before Style:** Fixing broken HTML first enabled all other improvements

5. **Cultural Authenticity:** One dynamic, respectful whakataukī >>> multiple hardcoded generic quotes
