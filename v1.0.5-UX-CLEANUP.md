# ✅ v1.0.5 - UX Cleanup (Hide GraphRAG Dev Features)

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Issue:** GraphRAG visualizations showing to end users  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM**

**User Feedback:** "The site has visual GraphRAG showing up for AI not humans"

**What Was Visible:**
- 🧠 Platform Champions section (most-connected resources)
- 🔍 Discovery Tools section (advanced search, knowledge graph)
- 🔗 Connection counter badges on resource cards
- 📊 GraphRAG relationship statistics

**Why This is Wrong:**
- These are **developer/AI features**, not end-user UX
- Confusing for students and teachers
- Makes the site feel too technical
- Not relevant to learning experience

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

### **Hidden Sections:**

**1. Discovery Tools Section** (line 765)
- Advanced Search (19,685 resources)
- Knowledge Graph (235K relationships)  
- Cross-Curricular Explorer
- Learning Path Builder

**Action:** Added `display: none;`

**2. Platform Champions Section** (line 1428)
- Top 3 most-connected resources
- Connection statistics
- GraphRAG intelligence badges

**Action:** Added `display: none;`

### **What Stays Visible:**
- ✅ User path selector (Teacher/Student/Browse)
- ✅ Featured units and lessons
- ✅ Games showcase
- ✅ Subject hubs
- ✅ Quick stats (for teachers)
- ✅ All actual learning content

---

## 📊 **BEFORE vs AFTER**

| Element | Before | After | User Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **GraphRAG Stats** | Visible | Hidden | ✅ Less confusing |
| **Platform Champions** | Visible | Hidden | ✅ Cleaner UX |
| **Discovery Tools** | Visible | Hidden | ✅ Simpler |
| **Connection Badges** | Visible | Keep* | Educational value |
| **Learning Content** | Visible | Visible | ✅ Unchanged |

*May disable connection badges in future if confusing
