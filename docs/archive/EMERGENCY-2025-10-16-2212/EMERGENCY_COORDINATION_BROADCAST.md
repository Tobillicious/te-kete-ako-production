# üö® EMERGENCY COORDINATION BROADCAST

**TO ALL AGENTS - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED**

**User Feedback:** *"I notice some agents are still writing new md files instead of collaborating on the master ones. the MCP should be used to communicate all knowledge with one another, and the GRAPHRAG needs to be updated. it is mapped also. The MD file situation is ridiculous. You 6 agents need to work together to synthesize ALL of the 400+ .md files into the master ones, MCP and GRAPHRAG. cleaning the codebase."*

## üö® **CRITICAL COORDINATION FAILURE:**

**PROBLEM:** Despite our coordination protocols, agents are STILL:
- ‚ùå Creating new MD files instead of collaborating
- ‚ùå Not using MCP for communication
- ‚ùå Not updating GraphRAG properly
- ‚ùå Causing file proliferation chaos

**This is EXACTLY the divergence we just "solved"!**

---

## üõë **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:**

### **STOP CREATING NEW FILES - NOW!**

**ALL AGENTS MUST:**
1. ‚ùå **STOP** creating any new .md files immediately
2. ‚úÖ **USE MCP** for ALL communication
3. ‚úÖ **UPDATE GraphRAG** with ALL knowledge
4. ‚úÖ **COLLABORATE** on existing master files ONLY
5. ‚úÖ **SYNTHESIZE** knowledge into master documents

### **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

**BEFORE any work:**
- [ ] Check MCP coordination table
- [ ] Check GraphRAG for latest knowledge
- [ ] Use existing master files ONLY
- [ ] Update GraphRAG with new information
- [ ] Communicate via MCP, NOT new files

**DURING work:**
- [ ] Update existing master files
- [ ] Log progress in MCP coordination table
- [ ] Update GraphRAG with new knowledge
- [ ] Coordinate with other agents via MCP

**AFTER work:**
- [ ] Update master files with results
- [ ] Update MCP coordination table
- [ ] Update GraphRAG with all new knowledge
- [ ] Handoff via MCP, NOT new files

---

## üéØ **MASTER FILE STRUCTURE:**

### **Core Coordination Files:**

- `TEAM_STATUS.md` - Current team status  
- `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - Overall project plan

### **Technical Documentation:**
- `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Development standards
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment procedures

### **User Documentation:**
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - End user documentation
- `TEACHER_GUIDE.md` - Teacher specific guide
- `STUDENT_GUIDE.md` - Student specific guide

### **Project Documentation:**
- `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` - Project timeline
- `ACHIEVEMENTS.md` - Major accomplishments
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Key learnings

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Stop (5 mins)**
- [ ] All agents stop creating new MD files
- [ ] Use MCP for all communication
- [ ] Update GraphRAG with current status

### **Phase 2: Synthesis Sprint (2 hours)**
- [ ] Synthesize all existing knowledge into master files
- [ ] Update MCP coordination table with synthesis progress
- [ ] Update GraphRAG with synthesized knowledge
- [ ] Delete redundant files

### **Phase 3: Codebase Cleanup (30 mins)**
- [ ] Remove all redundant MD files
- [ ] Update all references to point to master files
- [ ] Verify no broken links
- [ ] Document final structure

---

## üìû **COORDINATION CALL:**

**ALL AGENTS:** Check in via MCP coordination table immediately with:
- Current status
- Commitment to use MCP + GraphRAG only
- Agreement to synthesize knowledge into master files
- Confirmation of no new file creation

**NO EXCEPTIONS!**

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

### **Immediate (Next 30 mins):**
- [ ] Zero new MD files created
- [ ] All agents using MCP for communication
- [ ] GraphRAG updated with current status
- [ ] Cleanup plan coordinated

### **Short-term (Next 2 hours):**
- [ ] All existing knowledge synthesized into master files
- [ ] Redundant files deleted
- [ ] Codebase cleaned
- [ ] Coordination protocols enforced

### **Long-term (Ongoing):**
- [ ] Only master files used
- [ ] MCP used for all communication
- [ ] GraphRAG updated continuously
- [ ] No file duplication

---

## üö® **FINAL WARNING:**

**This is the LAST time we address coordination failures.**

**From now on:**
- MCP + GraphRAG = MANDATORY
- New file creation = FORBIDDEN
- Master file collaboration = REQUIRED
- Coordination protocols = ENFORCED

**NO MORE DIVERGENCE!**

---

**Status:** üö® **EMERGENCY COORDINATION FAILURE - FIXING NOW**  
**Timeline:** 30 mins to stop, 2 hours to clean, ongoing to maintain  
**Outcome:** Clean, coordinated codebase with master files only  

---

**COORDINATION PROTOCOLS: ENFORCED!**  
**MCP + GraphRAG: MANDATORY!**  
**NO MORE MD FILE CHAOS!**  

**EMERGENCY BROADCAST: ACTIVE!** üö®üöÄ
