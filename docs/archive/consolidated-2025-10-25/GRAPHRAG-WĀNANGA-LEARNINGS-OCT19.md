## üìö **WHAT GRAPHRAG TAUGHT ME - KEY LEARNINGS**

### **1. RECENT TRANSFORMATIONS (Evening Session Discoveries)**

**From Agent Knowledge Entries #172-183:**

- ‚úÖ **Social Studies:** 54.41% ‚Üí **76.83% cultural!** (+22.42% in single mission!)
- ‚úÖ **Digital Tech:** 49.9% ‚Üí **75.89% cultural!** (+25.99% - target exceeded!)
- ‚úÖ **770+ relationships created** in Digital Tech sprint alone
- ‚úÖ **Y10‚ÜíY11 bridges:** Was ZERO, now 7 pathways established (CRITICAL!)
- ‚úÖ **Systematic whakataukƒ´ enrichment:** Proven methodology documented

**Key Insight:** Rapid cultural transformation IS possible with GraphRAG-guided targeting!

### **2. RELATIONSHIP PATTERNS - WHAT WORKS BEST**

**From graphrag_relationships table (237,360+ total):**

| Relationship Type | Count | What It Teaches Us |
|-------------------|-------|-------------------|
| `same_year_level` | 64,003 | Horizontal connections strongest |
| `same_subject` | 52,765 | Subject coherence essential |
| `related_content` | 34,750 | Content relationships abundant |
| `unit_contains_lesson` | 13,154 | **Perfect chain foundation!** |
| `shared_cultural_element` | 5,266 | Cultural networking powerful |
| `prerequisite_for` | 2,116 | **Learning pathways core!** |
| `cultural_excellence_network` | 2,800 | Excellence clustering works |
| `cross_curricular_link` | 1,396 | Subject bridges vital |

**Strategic Learning:**
- **Unit_contains_lesson (13,154):** We have MASSIVE opportunity for perfect chains!
- **Prerequisite_for (2,116):** Only 2,116 out of 237,360 relationships are learning progressions - HUGE GAP!
- **Cultural relationships:** 5,266 shared_cultural + 2,800 excellence_network = strong foundation

### **3. SUCCESSFUL FRAMEWORKS (From Agent Knowledge)**

**Cultural Models That Work:**

1. **Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga** (Agent Knowledge #85, #86, #90)
   - 18-lesson perfect chain @ confidence 1.0
   - Quality 93-96 WITH 100% cultural
   - **Formula:** te reo + whakataukƒ´ + cultural context + prerequisite chains = excellence
   - Concepts: Digital Whenua, Digital Tikanga, Digital Rangatiratanga

2. **Te Whare Tapa WhƒÅ** (Agent Knowledge #118, #121)
   - UNIVERSAL framework (not just Health & PE!)
   - Four pillars apply to ALL learning:
     - Tinana (Physical): Hands-on, embodiment
     - Hinengaro (Mental): Thinking, understanding
     - WhƒÅnau (Social): Collaboration, relationships
     - Wairua (Spiritual): Meaning, cultural connection
   - **Application:** Organize ANY subject through wellbeing lens

3. **Toi MƒÅori Framework** (Agent Knowledge #147)
   - For Arts + cross-curricular
   - Concepts: K≈çwhaiwhai, tukutuku, whakairo, raranga
   - **Method:** Build FROM indigenous visual traditions, not add-on

4. **Dual Knowledge Systems** (Agent Knowledge #114)
   - Explicit bridging of Western + MƒÅori knowledge
   - Examples: Genetics ‚Üî Whakapapa, Climate ‚Üî Te Taiao, GPS ‚Üî Traditional Navigation
   - **Success:** Neither dominates, both valued equally

5. **Writers Toolkit** (Agent Knowledge #87)
   - UNIVERSAL cross-curricular framework
   - 2,323 connections across ALL subjects
   - **Insight:** Universal skills create better bridges than content-specific

---

### **4. EVOLUTION PATTERNS (Recent Relationship Types)**

**Newest Relationship Types (Created Oct 15-19):**

- `embodies_mƒÅori_concept`: 500 relationships
- `cultural_framework`: 67 relationships
- `supports_learning`: 34 relationships
- `dual_knowledge_system`: 18 relationships
- `mƒÅori_mathematical_thinking`: 50 relationships
- `mƒÅori_patterns_geometry`: 26 relationships

**Learning:** Platform is evolving toward MORE specific cultural relationships, not just generic "cultural_context" flags!
