### 8. Kaiako Notes

*   **Cultural:** Te Puea died 1952 but her influence continues. The current Māori King leads from Tūrangawaewae, the marae she built. This is living history.
*   **Unit Completion:** Students now understand one of Aotearoa's greatest leaders. This unit provides a model for studying the other five house leaders (Ngata, Hopa, Rickard, Wētere).
*   **Reflection:** Did students grasp the arc from dispossession to restoration? Do they understand how one person's determination can change history?
