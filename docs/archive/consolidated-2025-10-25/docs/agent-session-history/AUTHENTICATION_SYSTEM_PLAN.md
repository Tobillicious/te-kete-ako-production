# Authentication System Plan for Te Kete Ako

## Overview
The authentication system is critical for differentiating user experiences between students and teachers, which directly impacts navigation structure and content access. This plan addresses the current authentication conflicts and provides a clear path forward.

## Current State Analysis
- Multiple failed authentication attempts have created conflicts
- No clear differentiation between student and teacher experiences
- Navigation structure is impacted by user type requirements
- Authentication is needed before proper content integration

## User Types & Requirements

### Students
- **Primary Focus**: Learning and engagement
- **Navigation Needs**: Simple, guided pathways to content
- **Content Access**: Curated learning materials, assessments
- **Interface**: Clean, focused, minimal distractions

### Teachers
- **Primary Focus**: Teaching resources and classroom management
- **Navigation Needs**: Comprehensive resource access, planning tools
- **Content Access**: Full resource library, lesson plans, assessments
- **Interface**: Feature-rich, efficient workflow tools

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation
1. **Choose Authentication Method**
   - Supabase Auth (recommended - already integrated)
   - Clear existing conflicting authentication code
   - Implement clean authentication flow

2. **User Profile Structure**
   ```typescript
   interface UserProfile {
     id: string;
     email: string;
     userType: 'student' | 'teacher';
     school?: string;
     yearLevel?: number; // For students
     subjects?: string[]; // For teachers
     preferences: UserPreferences;
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Landing page with clear role selection
   - Separate login flows for students/teachers
   - Role-based dashboard after login

### Phase 2: Role-Based Navigation
1. **Student Navigation**
   - My Learning (dashboard)
   - Subjects/Courses
   - Assignments
   - Progress
   - Help/Support

2. **Teacher Navigation**
   - My Classroom (dashboard)
   - Resource Library (full access)
   - Lesson Planning
   - Student Management
   - Assessment Tools
   - Analytics

### Phase 3: Content Access Control
1. **Content Tagging System**
   - Tag all 6,604 files with appropriate access levels
   - Implement content filtering based on user type
   - Ensure cultural content respects appropriate access

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Students: Guided pathways through content
   - Teachers: Full search and browse capabilities

## Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Clear existing authentication conflicts
- [ ] Set up Supabase Auth
- [ ] Create user profile structure
- [ ] Implement basic login/logout

### Week 2: Role Differentiation
- [ ] Create role selection interface
- [ ] Implement student dashboard
- [ ] Implement teacher dashboard
- [ ] Set up role-based routing

### Week 3: Navigation Structure
- [ ] Build student navigation components
- [ ] Build teacher navigation components
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering
- [ ] Test navigation flows

### Week 4: Content Integration
- [ ] Tag content with access levels
- [ ] Implement content filtering
- [ ] Test content access by role
- [ ] Optimize performance

## Agent Assignments

### Primary Agents
- **Agent-10**: Authentication system implementation (Coordination specialist)
- **Agent-3**: User interface design (Content specialist)
- **Agent-4**: Navigation structure (Navigation specialist)

### Supporting Agents
- **Agent-7**: Cultural validation of authentication flows
- **Agent-9**: Accessibility compliance for all user types
- **Agent-8**: Performance optimization of authentication system
- **Agent-11**: Browser testing across devices

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Implement proper session management
- Secure password handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API security for content access

### Performance
- Lazy loading of role-specific components
- Efficient content filtering
- Optimized database queries
- Caching strategies

### Cultural Considerations
- Māori language options throughout
- Culturally appropriate user flows
- Accessibility for all users
- Inclusive design principles

## Success Metrics
- Authentication success rate >95%
- User satisfaction scores >4.5/5
- Navigation efficiency (time to content)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

## Next Steps
1. Assign Agent-10 to lead authentication implementation
2. Begin clearing existing authentication conflicts
3. Set up Supabase Auth configuration
4. Create user profile structure in database
5. Implement basic authentication flow

This authentication system will provide the foundation for proper content integration and user-specific experiences, enabling us to effectively organize and present the 6,604 educational resources we've discovered.
