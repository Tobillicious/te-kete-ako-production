# ÔøΩÔøΩ PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (PCK) RESEARCH FRAMEWORK
**For:** Te Kete Ako Enhancement Passes 4-7
**Purpose:** Deep pedagogical understanding for each subject area

---

## üéØ WHAT IS PCK?

**Pedagogical Content Knowledge** = Subject expertise + Teaching expertise

**Components:**
1. **Content Knowledge:** Deep understanding of subject matter
2. **Pedagogical Knowledge:** How students learn
3. **PCK:** How to teach THIS specific content to THESE specific students

**Example:**
- **Content:** Fractions (mathematical concept)
- **Pedagogy:** Scaffolding, visual aids, practice
- **PCK:** Using pizza slices for Y7, algebraic fractions for Y13, connecting to whakapapa for cultural relevance

---

## üìä PCK BY SUBJECT AREA

### Mathematics PCK:
- Common misconceptions (e.g., "bigger denominator = bigger fraction")
- Concrete ‚Üí Pictorial ‚Üí Abstract progression
- Real-world contexts (navigation, patterns, data)
- Cultural connections (tƒÅniko patterns, navigation, whakapapa)

### Science PCK:
- Inquiry-based learning cycles
- Practical investigations
- Connecting to mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori (rongoƒÅ, ecology, astronomy)
- Safety considerations

### Social Sciences PCK:
- Source analysis skills
- Historical thinking concepts
- Multiple perspectives (especially tangata whenua)
- Guided social inquiry projects

### English/Literacy PCK:
- Reading comprehension strategies
- Writing process approaches
- Oral language development
- Cultural storytelling (p≈´rƒÅkau)

---

## üîÑ PARALLEL PCK EXPLORATION

**Strategy:** Use different approaches in parallel, compare effectiveness

### Approach A: Traditional NZ Pedagogy
- Explicit teaching
- Guided practice
- Independent practice
- Assessment

### Approach B: Inquiry-Based
- Question generation
- Investigation
- Evidence gathering
- Conclusion/presentation

### Approach C: Culturally Responsive
- Ako (reciprocal learning)
- Tuakana-teina (peer teaching)
- WƒÅnanga (collaborative discussion)
- Connection to identity

### Approach D: Differentiated
- Multiple entry points
- Tiered activities
- Choice boards
- Flexible grouping

**For each resource:** Determine which approach(es) fit best

## üìã YEAR-SPECIFIC CONTENT CREATION

### Example: "Algebraic Thinking in MƒÅori Games"

**Year 7 Version:**
- Focus: Patterns and sequences in m≈´ t≈çrere
- PCK: Concrete manipulatives, visual patterns
- Assessment: Pattern recognition, simple rules
- Inquiry: "What patterns do you notice?"

**Year 9 Version:**
- Focus: Algebraic expressions from game strategies
- PCK: Bridge from patterns to variables
- Assessment: Writing expressions, solving equations
- Inquiry: "Can you predict winning strategies?"

**Year 11 Version:**
- Focus: Game theory and optimization
- PCK: Systems of equations, probability
- Assessment: Mathematical modeling, NCEA standards
- Inquiry: "What's the optimal strategy and why?"

**Year 13 Version:**
- Focus: Advanced game theory, matrices
- PCK: Linear algebra applications
- Assessment: Research project, formal proof
- Inquiry: "Design a new game with mathematical properties"

**Result:** 4 different resources, not 1 adapted resource

#### 2. Summative Assessments (End of Unit)
- Written tests/quizzes
- Projects
- Presentations
- Portfolios

#### 3. Self-Assessment
- Rubrics for students
- Reflection prompts
- Goal-setting templates
- Progress tracking

#### 4. Peer Assessment
- Structured feedback forms
- Gallery walks
- Peer review protocols
- Collaborative rubrics

#### 5. Portfolio Evidence

#### 6. Practical Demonstrations
- Performance tasks
- Skills demonstrations
- Real-world applications
- Community projects

#### 7. Guided Social Inquiry Projects
- Essential question
- Research process
- Evidence gathering
- Action/presentation

## üí° NEXT STEPS

1. ‚úÖ Complete Pass 3 (learning structure)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Research PCK for each subject area
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Start Pass 4 with comprehensive assessment suites
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Identify resources needing year-specific versions
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Create guided inquiry project templates

**This is deep pedagogical work - not just adding sections!**
