# Te Kete Ako - Educational Content Protection Protocol

## 🎯 **MISSION: ZERO EDUCATIONAL CONTENT LOSS**

### **Philosophy: Content First, Systems Second**
Before any cleanup, migration, or system changes, we establish an impenetrable protection system around all 624 educational resources and 4 major cultural platforms.

## 🛡️ **MULTI-LAYER PROTECTION SYSTEM**

### **Layer 1: IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY BACKUP**
Create multiple backup layers before ANY system changes:

```bash
# Layer 1A: Complete System Snapshot
tar -czf "EMERGENCY-BACKUP-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz" te-kete-ako-clean/

# Layer 1B: Educational Content Only
tar -czf "EDUCATIONAL-CONTENT-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz" \
  te-kete-ako-clean/handouts/ \
  te-kete-ako-clean/lessons/ \
  te-kete-ako-clean/games/ \
  te-kete-ako-clean/units/ \
  te-kete-ako-clean/y8-systems/ \
  te-kete-ako-clean/digital-purakau.html \
  te-kete-ako-clean/living-whakapapa.html \
  te-kete-ako-clean/virtual-marae.html \
  te-kete-ako-clean/classroom-leaderboard.html

# Layer 1C: Critical Platforms Only  
tar -czf "CULTURAL-PLATFORMS-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz" \
  te-kete-ako-clean/digital-purakau.html \
  te-kete-ako-clean/living-whakapapa.html \
  te-kete-ako-clean/virtual-marae.html \
  te-kete-ako-clean/classroom-leaderboard.html
```

### **Layer 2: CLOUD REDUNDANCY**
- Upload backups to multiple cloud storage locations
- Create git repository snapshots
- Document all file locations and dependencies

### **Layer 3: CONTENT INTEGRITY VERIFICATION**
Create checksums and verification systems:

```bash
# Generate integrity hashes for all educational content
find te-kete-ako-clean/ -name "*.html" -type f | \
  grep -E "(handouts|lessons|games|units|y8-systems)" | \
  xargs md5sum > EDUCATIONAL_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS.txt

# Critical platforms integrity check
md5sum te-kete-ako-clean/digital-purakau.html >> CRITICAL_PLATFORMS_CHECKSUMS.txt
md5sum te-kete-ako-clean/living-whakapapa.html >> CRITICAL_PLATFORMS_CHECKSUMS.txt  
md5sum te-kete-ako-clean/virtual-marae.html >> CRITICAL_PLATFORMS_CHECKSUMS.txt
md5sum te-kete-ako-clean/classroom-leaderboard.html >> CRITICAL_PLATFORMS_CHECKSUMS.txt
```

---

## 📋 **CONTENT PROTECTION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **Pre-Change Verification (MANDATORY before any modifications):**
```
□ Complete system backup created and verified
□ Educational content backup created and verified  
□ Critical platforms backup created and verified
□ File integrity checksums generated
□ All 624 resources accounted for in backup
□ Critical platform functionality tested and documented
□ Database export completed (if applicable)
□ Recovery procedures tested and validated
```

### **Critical Platform Functionality Tests:**
```
□ Digital Pūrākau: Interactive storytelling loads correctly
□ Living Whakapapa: Multimedia mapping system operational  
□ Virtual Marae: VR training protocols accessible
□ Classroom Leaderboard: Progress tracking functional
□ All navigation links between platforms working
□ Cultural content displays correctly (Te Reo Māori characters)
□ Assessment frameworks load and display properly
```

### **Educational Resource Access Tests:**
```
□ All handouts accessible via direct links
□ Y8 Systems Unit resources load completely
□ Writer's Toolkit lessons display correctly
□ Video activities multimedia elements functional
□ Games load and run without errors
□ Assessment rubrics display formatting correctly
```

## 🔒 **CONTENT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS**

### **Protocol 1: NO DIRECT MODIFICATIONS**
- **NEVER** edit critical educational files directly
- **ALWAYS** work on copies in staging environment
- **ALWAYS** verify backups before making changes

### **Protocol 2: STAGED ROLLOUT APPROACH**
1. **Copy** educational content to staging environment
2. **Test** all modifications in staging first
3. **Verify** educational content integrity
4. **Deploy** only after successful testing
5. **Monitor** for any issues post-deployment

### **Protocol 3: IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK CAPABILITY**
- Maintain working backup at all times
- Document exact steps to restore from backup
- Test rollback procedures before needed
- Have emergency contact procedures ready

---

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES**

### **If Educational Content Goes Missing:**
1. **STOP ALL SYSTEM CHANGES IMMEDIATELY**
2. **Assess scope of loss** - what specific content is affected?
3. **Restore from most recent backup** without delay
4. **Verify restoration completeness** using checksums
5. **Document what went wrong** for future prevention
6. **Test all educational functionality** before proceeding

### **If Critical Platforms Malfunction:**
1. **Identify affected platform(s)**
2. **Check backup integrity** for those specific platforms  
3. **Restore platform files** from verified backup
4. **Test platform functionality** thoroughly
5. **Verify cultural content** displays correctly
6. **Document issue and resolution** 

### **If Database Migration Corrupts Content:**
1. **Halt migration immediately**
2. **Export current database state** for analysis
3. **Restore database** from pre-migration backup
4. **Verify all educational content** accessible via GraphRAG
5. **Plan alternative migration approach**
6. **Test extensively** before attempting migration again

## 🎯 **CONTENT PROTECTION AUTOMATION**

### **Automated Backup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Educational Content Protection Backup
# Run this before ANY system changes

BACKUP_DIR="./educational-content-backups"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

echo "🛡️ Starting Educational Content Protection Backup..."

# Critical platforms backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/critical-platforms-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" \
  digital-purakau.html \
  living-whakapapa.html \
  virtual-marae.html \
  classroom-leaderboard.html

# Educational resources backup  
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/educational-resources-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" \
  handouts/ lessons/ games/ units/ y8-systems/

# Generate integrity checksums
find . -name "*.html" -type f | \
  grep -E "(handouts|lessons|games|units|y8-systems|digital-purakau|living-whakapapa|virtual-marae|classroom-leaderboard)" | \
  xargs md5sum > "$BACKUP_DIR/integrity-checksums-$TIMESTAMP.txt"

echo "✅ Educational Content Protection Backup Complete!"
echo "📁 Backups stored in: $BACKUP_DIR"
echo "🔐 Checksums: integrity-checksums-$TIMESTAMP.txt"
```

### **Content Integrity Monitor:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify educational content integrity
# Run this after any system changes

echo "🔍 Verifying Educational Content Integrity..."

# Check critical platforms exist
CRITICAL_FILES=("digital-purakau.html" "living-whakapapa.html" "virtual-marae.html" "classroom-leaderboard.html")

for file in "${CRITICAL_FILES[@]}"; do
  if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
    echo "✅ $file - Present"
  else  
    echo "🚨 CRITICAL: $file - MISSING!"
    exit 1
  fi
done

# Count educational resources
HANDOUT_COUNT=$(find handouts/ -name "*.html" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
LESSON_COUNT=$(find lessons/ -name "*.html" 2>/dev/null | wc -l) 
GAME_COUNT=$(find games/ -name "*.html" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

echo "📊 Resource Counts:"
echo "   Handouts: $HANDOUT_COUNT files"
echo "   Lessons: $LESSON_COUNT files"  
echo "   Games: $GAME_COUNT files"

if [[ $HANDOUT_COUNT -lt 300 ]]; then
  echo "🚨 WARNING: Handout count lower than expected!"
fi

echo "✅ Educational Content Integrity Check Complete"
```

### **Phase 2: STAGING ENVIRONMENT (Week 2)**  
1. Create isolated copy of entire system
2. Test all educational content in staging
3. Practice migration procedures safely
4. Verify backup/restore processes work
5. Plan gradual rollout strategy

### **Phase 3: PROTECTED MIGRATION (Week 3-4)**
1. Apply changes to staging first
2. Verify educational content integrity  
3. Test critical platform functionality
4. Deploy changes with rollback ready
5. Monitor for any content issues

## 🏆 **PROTECTION SUCCESS DEFINITION**

**SUCCESS = All educational content preserved through any system changes**

Specifically:
- All 4 critical cultural platforms functional
- All 624 educational resources accessible  
- Zero broken links to educational content
- Cultural integrity maintained (Te Reo Māori, etc.)
- GraphRAG search continues to find 100% of resources
- Teachers can access everything they could before
- Students experience no disruption to learning resources

**FAILURE = Even 1 critical educational resource permanently lost**
