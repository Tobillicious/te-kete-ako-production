# Te Kete Ako: Curriculum Development and Professionalization Plan

## 1. Project Vision

To transform Te Kete Ako into a world-class, culturally responsive educational platform for Mangakōtukutuku College. This will be achieved by creating deep, interconnected units of learning that are grounded in the school's values (Whaimana, Whaiora, Whaiara) and centered on the stories of the six house leaders.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Leader-Centric:** Each unit will be anchored by the biography and contributions of one of the six house leaders.
*   **Value-Driven:** The school's values will be explicitly woven into the learning activities and content.
*   **Inquiry-Based:** Students will be encouraged to engage in critical thinking and research.
*   **Culturally Affirming:** The curriculum will center Māori perspectives, knowledge, and history.
*   **Interconnected:** Lessons will be linked to create a cohesive and narrative-driven learning experience.

## 3. Proposed Unit Structure

The curriculum will be organized into six core units, each named after one of the house leaders. While each unit will have a specific focus, they will all be interconnected and will contribute to a broader understanding of the history and future of Aotearoa.

## 4. Next Steps

The research and planning phase for the six core curriculum units is now complete. The `CURRICULUM_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` provides a comprehensive blueprint for the professionalization of the Te Kete Ako platform.

The next phase of this project is **Content Creation**. I will now begin the process of transforming these unit plans into fully-developed, 75-minute lesson packages, complete with handouts, activities, and assessments. I will start with **Unit 1: Walker - The Challenge to the Narrative**, and I will create the first lesson, **Lesson 1.1: Who was Ranginui Walker?**.
