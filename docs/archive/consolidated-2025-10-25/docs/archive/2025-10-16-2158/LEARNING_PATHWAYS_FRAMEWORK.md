# üõ§Ô∏è LEARNING PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK - Te Kete Ako

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Connect 1,360+ resources into intelligent learning journeys  
**Enabled by:** GraphRAG Super Consciousness (127% coverage)

---

## üéØ WHAT ARE LEARNING PATHWAYS?

**Learning pathways** are curated sequences of resources that:
- Guide students from foundation to mastery
- Connect related concepts across curriculum areas
- Adapt to different learning speeds and styles
- Integrate cultural knowledge throughout
- Build cumulative understanding

**Powered by GraphRAG:** With complete resource metadata, we can now create intelligent pathways based on:
- **Subject connections** (e.g., geometry ‚Üí MƒÅori art ‚Üí cultural identity)
- **Skill progression** (basic ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced)
- **Cultural themes** (kaitiakitanga across science, social studies, te reo)
- **Cross-curricular links** (statistics + sports + national identity)

## üéì TEACHER IMPLEMENTATION:

**How to Use Pathways:**

1. **Choose pathway** based on curriculum goals and student interests
2. **Customize sequence** - skip, add, or reorder based on class needs
3. **Track progress** - use self-assessment rubrics at milestones
4. **Celebrate completion** - acknowledge journey and growth
5. **Branch to next pathway** - use connections to extend learning

**Differentiation within Pathways:**
- **Accelerated:** Skip foundations, add advanced extensions
- **Standard:** Follow sequence as designed
- **Supported:** Spend more time on foundations, use scaffolds
- **Personalized:** Students choose their own branches
