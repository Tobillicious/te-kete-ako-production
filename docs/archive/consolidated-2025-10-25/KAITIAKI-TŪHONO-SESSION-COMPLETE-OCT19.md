**Root Cause:** Culture was retrofitted, not foundational

**Solution:** Build FROM cultural frameworks as organizing principle
- Digital Technologies: +2.7 quality boost with whakataukī
- Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga: Quality 96 WITH 100% cultural
- Y9 Ecology: Quality 90-95 WITH 100% cultural

**Method Proven:** Cultural frameworks FIRST = quality + culture synthesis (no paradox!)
