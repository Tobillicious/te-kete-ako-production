# 🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK APPLIED

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Issue:** Site completely broken - content covered/blocked  
**Action:** Reverted commit d880d8a2b

---

## ⚠️ **WHAT I BROKE**

**Commit Reverted:**
```
d880d8a2b - v1.0.6: Remove GraphRAG dev links from main navigation
```

**What I Changed (that broke things):**
- Attempted to hide GraphRAG brain/intelligence navigation items
- May have introduced unclosed comments or broken HTML structure
- Changes caused full-screen blocking issue

---

## ✅ **ROLLBACK STATUS**

**Reverted:** YES  
**Pushed:** YES  
**Deployed:** Netlify rebuilding now (~2-3 min)

---

## 🔍 **DIAGNOSIS**

**What Went Wrong:**
- Navigation is minified (single-line HTML)
- HTML comments in minified code can break structure
- Broken navigation = broken page layout (it loads on every page)

**Why It Covered Everything:**
- Navigation likely rendered as broken full-screen overlay
- CSS `position: sticky` + broken HTML = blocks content
- Affected ALL pages (sitewide component)

---

## 📋 **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **DON'T edit minified files directly**
2. **Test changes before deploying**
3. **Revert fast when something breaks**
4. **Keep GraphRAG backend, hide via CSS not HTML edits**

---

## 🎯 **CORRECT APPROACH (Next Time)**

Instead of editing navigation HTML:
```css
/* Hide via CSS in te-kete-professional.css */
.nav-link[href*="graphrag-brain"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```

This is safer than editing minified components!

**Status:** 🔄 **ROLLED BACK - Site should work in 2-3 minutes**
