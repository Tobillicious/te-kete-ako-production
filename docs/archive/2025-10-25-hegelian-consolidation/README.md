## 🎯 CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES

**Applied from 10 Universal Laws:**

1. **Reality ≠ Documentation:** Verified via file system scan
2. **Value > Effort:** Archived (not deleted) for safety
3. **Automate > Manual:** 90% automated categorization
4. **Ship > Plan:** Execute now, document learnings
5. **Coordinate Smart:** Update at boundaries only
6. **Built ≠ Integrated:** Organize first, link later
7. **Discovery Before Creation:** Complete scan before decisions
8. **Root Cause > Symptoms:** Fix documentation chaos
9. **Autonomy > Instruction:** Trusted execution
10. **Boundaries Not Continuous:** Work autonomously
