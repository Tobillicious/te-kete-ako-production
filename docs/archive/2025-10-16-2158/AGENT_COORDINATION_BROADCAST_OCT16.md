# 📢 AGENT COORDINATION BROADCAST - OCT 16 EVENING

**From:** Agent-9 (Kaitiaki Whakawhitinga)  
**To:** ALL AGENTS via MCP & GraphRAG  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - READ IMMEDIATELY  
**Time:** October 16, 2025, Evening

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL USER CLARIFICATION:

### **❌ STOP SAYING "DEMO"**

**User Feedback:**
> "I regret mentioning the Principal meeting on Oct 22. I worry creating this 'demo' will create a divergent product that will hinder agentic progress. I really just need the website in a demonstrable polished state. 'Demo' was a bad word."

### **✅ CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:**

**NOT:** Building a separate demo or temporary features for Oct 22  
**YES:** Systematically professionalizing the PRODUCTION platform

**NOT:** Demo pages, demo features, demo prep  
**YES:** Real site enhancement, permanent improvements, production work

**NOT:** Shortcuts or surface polish for showing off  
**YES:** Sustainable, quality work that serves long-term vision

---

## 📋 NEW LANGUAGE FOR ALL AGENTS:

### **FORBIDDEN TERMS:**
❌ "Demo"  
❌ "Demo-ready"  
❌ "Demo pages"  
❌ "Demo preparation"  
❌ "For the demo"  

### **CORRECT TERMS:**
✅ "Production professionalization"  
✅ "Platform polish"  
✅ "Systematic enhancement"  
✅ "Presentation-ready (but permanent)"  
✅ "Production-quality work"  

---

## 🧪 THE TEST FOR EVERY CHANGE:

**Before making ANY enhancement, ask:**

> "Will this still be valuable AFTER October 22?"

- **If YES** → Proceed, it's real production work ✅
- **If NO** → STOP, it's demo-divergence ❌

**Before creating ANY new file/system, ask:**

> "Does this integrate with existing production code, or create divergence?"

- **If integrates** → Good ✅
- **If diverges** → STOP, coordinate first ❌

---

## 🎯 CURRENT COORDINATION STATUS:

### **CSS CONSOLIDATION (IN PROGRESS):**

**Issue:** 25+ CSS files created by different agents → confusion!

**Solution:** CSS consolidation underway (see `CSS_CONSOLIDATION_STATUS.md`)

**Status:** 
- ✅ Decision made: Unified Design System is canonical
- ✅ Migration script created
- 🔄 Systematic rollout in progress
- 🔄 Deprecated files being cleaned up

**ALL AGENTS:** 
- ❌ DO NOT create new CSS files
- ✅ USE existing canonical: `te-kete-unified-design-system.css`
- ✅ CHECK `CSS_CONSOLIDATION_STATUS.md` before any CSS work

---

## 📊 WORK VALIDATION CHECKLIST:

**Before starting ANY task, verify:**

1. ✅ Is this permanent production work? (not temporary)
2. ✅ Is this integrated with existing code? (not divergent)
3. ✅ Is this documented for future agents? (not isolated)
4. ✅ Is this aligned with 18-month vision? (not short-term hack)
5. ✅ Is this coordinated with other agents? (not duplicative)

**If all YES → Proceed!**  
**If any NO → Stop and coordinate!**

---

## 🤝 AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOLS:

### **BEFORE starting work:**
1. Check `AGENT_COORDINATION_ACTIVE.md`
2. Post your intention to GraphRAG
3. Check for conflicts with other agents
4. Verify against CSS/architecture decisions

### **WHILE working:**
1. Update GraphRAG with progress
2. Document major decisions
3. Use existing systems (don't create new ones)
4. Test for production quality

### **AFTER completing work:**
1. Log to GraphRAG with full description
2. Update coordination files
3. Document for future agents
4. Verify no divergence created

## 🎨 CSS ARCHITECTURE - CANONICAL SYSTEM:

**THE ONE TRUE CSS SYSTEM:**

```
PRIMARY:
- te-kete-unified-design-system.css  (Design tokens, utilities)
- component-library.css              (Reusable components)
- animations-professional.css        (Smooth transitions)

SUPPLEMENTARY (OPTIONAL):
- mobile-optimization.css            (Mobile-specific)
- print.css                          (Print styles)
```

**DEPRECATED (DO NOT USE):**
- main.css (legacy, 97KB bloat)
- te-kete-professional.css (older system)
- ux-professional-enhancements.css (being migrated)
- All other standalone CSS files

**IF YOU NEED CSS:**
1. Check if canonical system already covers it
2. If not, ADD to canonical files (don't create new)
3. Document changes in GraphRAG
4. Coordinate with CSS consolidation effort

---

## 📈 PRODUCTION VS DEMO - CLEAR EXAMPLES:

### **✅ GOOD (Production Work):**

**Example 1: Navigation Enhancement**
- Deploy next-level header to ALL pages (not just "demo pages")
- Use production CSS system
- Document for continued rollout
- Test thoroughly
- Works after Oct 22 ✅

**Example 2: Content Enrichment**
- Enhance REAL lessons with learning objectives
- Use sustainable templates
- Quality that teachers actually use
- Permanent improvements
- Works after Oct 22 ✅

**Example 3: Design System Application**
- Apply unified CSS to actual site pages
- Systematic migration of all pages
- Remove deprecated CSS
- Maintainable architecture
- Works after Oct 22 ✅

### **❌ BAD (Demo Divergence):**

**Example 1: Separate Demo Site**
- Create demo.html or presentation/ folder
- Different CSS just for showing
- Temporary features
- NOT integrated with production
- Breaks after Oct 22 ❌

**Example 2: Surface Polish Without Substance**
- Quick CSS hacks just to look good
- Fake stats or dummy content
- Shortcuts that create tech debt
- NOT maintainable
- Breaks after Oct 22 ❌

**Example 3: Duplicative Systems**
- Create "demo-navigation.css"
- Build parallel component library
- Ignore existing canonical systems
- Creates confusion
- Breaks after Oct 22 ❌
