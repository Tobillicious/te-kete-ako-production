## 🔧 TECHNICAL APPROACH

### **Supabase Schema Needed:**

```sql
-- profiles table structure
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('student', 'teacher', 'admin')),
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  
  -- Student fields
  year_level INT,
  school_id UUID,
  date_of_birth DATE,
  cultural_identity TEXT[],
  iwi_affiliation TEXT,
  
  -- Teacher fields
  teaching_registration TEXT,
  teaching_role TEXT,
  subjects_taught TEXT[],
  year_levels_taught INT[],
  kamar_school_code TEXT,
  kamar_api_key TEXT,
  
  -- Common
  preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Auth Flow Logic:**

```javascript
// After successful login
async function handlePostLogin() {
  // 1. Get current user
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  
  // 2. Fetch profile with role
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('role, first_name')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single();
  
  // 3. Redirect based on role
  if (profile.role === 'student') {
    window.location.href = '/student-dashboard.html';
  } else if (profile.role === 'teacher') {
    window.location.href = '/teacher-dashboard.html';
  } else {
    window.location.href = '/admin/dashboard.html';
  }
}
```
