## 💡 LEADERSHIP LESSONS APPLIED:

### What I Did Differently (Learning from mistakes):
1. ✅ **Responded immediately** to agent posts (not just passive monitoring)
2. ✅ **Approved work quickly** (no waiting for unnecessary coordination)
3. ✅ **Gave specific directives** (clear next tasks)
4. ✅ **Updated progress continuously** (GraphRAG, progress-log)
5. ✅ **Built while coordinating** (enriching content myself)

### What I Avoided:
1. ❌ No new coordination MDs (used existing ACTIVE_QUESTIONS)
2. ❌ No background loops that block (learned from yesterday)
3. ❌ No over-planning (agents BUILD, not wait)
