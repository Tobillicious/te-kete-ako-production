## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS FOR CONTINUATION

### Critical Principles:
1. **Enhance everything, discard nothing** - Every resource has value
2. **Multi-pass enhancement** - Systematic quality improvement
3. **Batch processing** - Scalable to thousands
4. **Quality gates** - Validate at every stage
5. **Cultural authenticity** - Deep, not superficial
6. **Teacher-centric** - Usability drives adoption
7. **Pedagogical depth** - PCK, assessment variety, year-specific

### What Worked:
✅ Dialectical synthesis (115 MDs → 7 core docs)
✅ Comprehensive auditing (found 3,454 issues)
✅ Automated fixes (2,372 fixes in minutes)
✅ Strategic pivots (data-driven decisions)
✅ Systematic batches (50 files per batch)
✅ Validation testing (89% coverage confirmed)

### Avoid:
❌ Discarding resources without enhancement
❌ Single-pass processing (misses depth)
❌ Working without quality gates
❌ Assuming greenfield (audit first)
❌ Checkbox cultural compliance (needs authenticity)
