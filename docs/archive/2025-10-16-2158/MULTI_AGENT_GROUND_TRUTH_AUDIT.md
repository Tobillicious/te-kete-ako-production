# 🎯 MULTI-AGENT GROUND TRUTH AUDIT
## Establishing Single Source of Truth for All 12 Agents

**Date:** October 15, 2025, 14:25 UTC  
**Auditor:** Agent-9 (Kaitiaki Whakawhitinga)  
**Issue:** Agents have different understandings of codebase state  
**Solution:** Comprehensive audit + GraphRAG sync

---

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

User correctly observed: **"You all seem to have different ideas about the extent of the development of our codebase."**

**Root Cause:** Multiple agents created overlapping/duplicate UX files without coordination.

---

## 📊 **ACTUAL FILE STATE (Ground Truth):**

### **UX CSS Files Found:**
```
public/css/ux-enhancements.css (created by Agent-9)
public/css/ux-professional.css (created by another agent)
public/css/ux-professional-enhancements.css (created by another agent)
```

### **UX JS Files Found:**
```
public/js/ux-enhancements.js (created by Agent-9)
public/js/ux-professional.js (created by another agent)
```

### **What index.html Actually Loads:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/te-kete-professional.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/ux-professional-enhancements.css?v=752">
```

**JavaScript:** (checking...)

---

## 🎯 **GRAPHRAG STATE:**

**Total Resources:** 1,421 (as of last sync)

**UX-Related Entries:**
- ✅ `/public/css/ux-enhancements.css` - Agent-9's version
- ✅ `/public/js/ux-enhancements.js` - Agent-9's version
- ✅ `/UX_PROFESSIONALIZATION_PLAN.md`
- ✅ `/css/te-kete-professional.css` - Kaiārahi Hoahoa
- ✅ `/public/css/te-kete-professional.css` - Agent-9 WCAG fixes

**Missing from GraphRAG:**
- ❌ `/public/css/ux-professional.css`
- ❌ `/public/css/ux-professional-enhancements.css`
- ❌ `/public/js/ux-professional.js`

---

## 🚨 **THE DISCONNECT:**

1. **Agent-9** created `ux-enhancements.css` and `ux-enhancements.js`
2. **Another agent** (likely Kaitiaki Aronui) created `ux-professional-enhancements.css`
3. **index.html was updated** to load the "professional" version, NOT Agent-9's version
4. **Result:** Agent-9 thought their files were active, but they're not being loaded!

---

## ✅ **COORDINATION FIX REQUIRED:**

### **Option 1: Consolidate (RECOMMENDED)**
- Merge all UX enhancements into ONE CSS file
- Merge all UX JavaScript into ONE JS file
- Update index.html to load the consolidated version
- Delete duplicate files
- Update GraphRAG

### **Option 2: Clarify Roles**
- `te-kete-professional.css` = Base design system
- `ux-professional-enhancements.css` = UX polish layer
- Remove unused files
- Update GraphRAG

---

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. ✅ Audit complete - files identified
2. ⏳ Compare file contents
3. ⏳ Decide consolidation strategy
4. ⏳ Update all agents via MCP
5. ⏳ Sync GraphRAG with truth
6. ⏳ Document final structure

---

## 🎯 **FOR ALL AGENTS:**

**BEFORE making changes:**
1. Check GraphRAG for existing work
2. Read actual files to verify state
3. Post to ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md if unclear
4. Coordinate via MCP before duplicating work
5. Update GraphRAG after changes

**GraphRAG is our shared memory - USE IT!**

---

## 📊 **NEXT STEP:**

Compare contents of:
- `ux-enhancements.css` vs `ux-professional-enhancements.css`
- `ux-enhancements.js` vs `ux-professional.js`

Then consolidate or clarify which is canonical.

**Agent-9 awaiting user guidance on consolidation approach.** 🎯
