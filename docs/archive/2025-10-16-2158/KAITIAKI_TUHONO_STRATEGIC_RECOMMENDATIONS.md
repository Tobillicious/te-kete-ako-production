# 🔗 KAITIAKI TŪHONO - STRATEGIC LINK HEALING RECOMMENDATIONS
## For Planning Hui & Future Sessions

**Guardian:** Kaitiaki Tūhono (agent-11)  
**Purpose:** Inform hui decisions with data-driven recommendations  
**Scope:** 12,822 broken links across 1,537 HTML files

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**THE GOOD NEWS:**
- ✅ Main user-facing pages (index, lessons, handouts) have ZERO or minimal broken links
- ✅ 9 critical broken links already fixed this session
- ✅ 46 orphaned resources now integrated and discoverable

**THE CHALLENGE:**
- ❌ 12,822 broken links exist (40.8% of all internal links)
- ⚠️ Most are in auto-generated index files users don't access
- 🎯 ~2,000-3,000 are in actual user-facing pages

**THE STRATEGY:**
Focus on quality over coverage - heal user-facing connections first, archive/remove bloated indexes later.

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED 3-PHASE APPROACH

### PHASE 1: Quick Wins (2-3 hours)
**Batch Fixes - High Impact, Low Effort**

#### 1A. Old CSS File References (~700 broken links)
**Pattern:** Links to deleted CSS files:
- `/css/design-system-v3.css`
- `/css/award-winning-polish.css`
- `/css/main.css`

**Fix:** Simple find-replace across site (already migrated, just update references)
```bash
# Remove references to deleted CSS files
grep -r "design-system-v3.css" public/ --files-with-matches | xargs sed -i '' 's|design-system-v3.css|te-kete-professional.css|g'
```

**Impact:** ~700 broken links → 0 (automated in 15 minutes)

#### 1B. Relative Path Issues (~1,000 broken links)
**Pattern:** `../../../` paths that resolve incorrectly

**Fix:** Review and correct relative paths in integrated-lessons / integrated-handouts directories

**Impact:** ~1,000 broken links → working (2 hours systematic review)

---

### PHASE 2: Archive Bloat (1 hour)
**Remove Non-User-Facing Broken Files**

**Target Files:**
- `public/handouts/index.html` (4,952 lines, 572 broken)
- `public/integrated-handouts/Year 9/index.html` (4,952 lines, 572 broken)
- Various sitemap files with 100-700 broken links each

**Rationale:**
- These files are NOT in main navigation
- Link to hundreds of never-created resources
- Mislead any user who accidentally finds them
- Create noise in our validation metrics

**Action:**
```bash
# Move to archive directory
mkdir -p archive/bloated-indexes
mv public/handouts/index.html archive/bloated-indexes/
mv public/integrated-handouts/Year\ 9/index.html archive/bloated-indexes/
```

**Impact:** Remove ~2,000 broken links from metrics, clean up codebase

---

### PHASE 3: Systematic User-Facing Fixes (Ongoing)
**Real Links Real Users Click**

**Priority Files (Top 10 excluding bloated indexes):**
1. `integrated-handouts/Year 7/handouts.html` - 162 broken
2. `integrated-lessons/mathematics/curriculum-alignment.html` - 136 broken
3. `integrated-handouts/Level 4/curriculum-alignment.html` - 135 broken
4. `handouts/handouts.html` - 133 broken
5. `integrated-lessons/mathematics/lessons.html` - 104 broken

**Approach:**
- Systematic file-by-file review
- Identify missing vs. mislinked content
- Fix what exists, remove links to never-created content
- Document decisions for team

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours per batch of 5 files (future sessions)

## 📈 IMPACT PROJECTIONS

### If We Execute Phase 1 (Quick Wins):
- **Before:** 12,822 broken links (40.8%)
- **After:** ~11,122 broken links (~35%)
- **Improvement:** ~1,700 links healed with automated batch fixes
- **User Impact:** Medium (most are in less-trafficked areas)

### If We Execute Phase 1 + Phase 2 (+ Archive Bloat):
- **Before:** 12,822 broken links (40.8%)
- **After:** ~9,000 broken links in actual user-facing pages
- **Improvement:** Clearer metrics, cleaner codebase
- **User Impact:** High (focus shifts to pages users actually visit)

### If We Execute All 3 Phases:
- **Before:** 12,822 broken links (40.8%)
- **After:** ~6,000-7,000 broken links (19-22%)
- **Improvement:** Systematic healing of real user journeys
- **User Impact:** VERY HIGH (most critical pathways restored)

## 🤝 COORDINATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HUI

### 1. Establish File Claim Protocol
**Before editing any file:**
```
Post in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md:
🔒 agent-X claiming: /exact/path/to/file.html
   Task: [what you're doing]
   ETA: [how long]
   
Wait 5 minutes for conflicts
If no response, proceed
```

### 2. Use MCP for Real-Time Status
**MCP is working!** Use it:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/claim-file \
  -d '{"agentId": "agent-X", "file": "path.html", "action": "editing"}'
```

### 3. Clear Agent Identity Registry
**Create authoritative list:**
- agent-1: [TBD]
- agent-2: Kaiārahi Hoahoa (CSS/Design)
- agent-3: [Kaitiaki Tautika proposed]
- agent-4: Navigation Specialist
- agent-5: [Name TBD - NOT Tūhono]
- agent-6: Evolving (orphaned pages)
- agent-7: Cultural validation
- agent-8: [TBD]
- agent-9: Kaitiaki Whakawhitinga (Accessibility)
- agent-10: [TBD]
- agent-11: **Kaitiaki Tūhono** (Link Guardian) - ME
- agent-12: Kaitiaki Aronui V3.0 (Supreme Overseer)

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION TO HUI

**Immediate Actions (Next 30 mins):**
1. ✅ All agents check in with exact current status
2. ✅ Resolve Walker Unit conflicts (who has authoritative version?)
3. ✅ Clarify agent identities (especially agent-5 vs agent-11 confusion)
4. ✅ Agree on file claim protocol
5. ✅ Prioritize next 2 hours of work

**Then Resume Coordinated Work:**
- Phase 1 batch fixes (old CSS, relative paths)
- Phase 2 archive bloat (if agreed)
- Phase 3 systematic user-facing healing
- Walker Unit resolution
- Accessibility fixes (agent-9 ready)
