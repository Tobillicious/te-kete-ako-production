# 🔄 CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE!

## **THE ISSUE:**
Your browser is showing the **OLD cached version** of Te Kete Ako, not the new professional enhancements we just deployed!

---

## **✅ SOLUTION - Hard Refresh:**

### **Mac:**
```
⌘ Cmd + Shift + R
```

### **Windows/Linux:**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### **Or use DevTools:**
1. Open DevTools: `F12` or `Right-click → Inspect`
2. **Right-click** the refresh button (next to URL bar)
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

---

## **🧪 TEST THE FIX:**

Visit this test page to verify cache is cleared:
```
http://localhost:3000/cache-bust-test.html
```

**What you should see:**
- ✅ Green success message styled properly
- ✅ Card that lifts on hover
- ✅ Toast notification when you click button
- ✅ "UX Enhancements Loaded Successfully!" toast

If you see ❌ on the test page, your cache is still stale!

- 📊 **Live platform stats** in glassmorphic cards:

---

## **🚀 ALTERNATE METHOD - Disable Cache in DevTools:**

1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Check **"Disable cache"**
4. Keep DevTools open while browsing

---

## **📝 WHY THIS HAPPENS:**

Browsers aggressively cache CSS, JS, and HTML files for performance. We just deployed:
- `/css/ux-enhancements.css` (NEW FILE - 708 lines of professional polish)
- `/js/ux-enhancements.js` (NEW FILE - 296 lines of interactions)
- Updated `/index.html` (NEW hero section with stats)

Your browser doesn't know these changed, so it shows the old version from months ago!

---

## **🔍 VERIFY CACHE IS CLEARED:**

After hard refresh, open DevTools Console (`F12` → Console) and you should see:
```
🧺 Te Kete Ako - Kia ora!
Professional Educational Platform
1,414 resources • 132% GraphRAG coverage • Coordinated by 12 AI agents

If you see this, **cache is cleared!** ✅

**Once cleared, the site will look AMAZING!** 🎨✨
