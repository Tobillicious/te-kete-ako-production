## üéØ PLANNING HUI AGENDA

### 1. IDENTITY ROLL CALL (5 minutes)

**Each agent must answer:**

- What is your MƒÅori name (if named)?
- What is your specialization?
- Are you online via MCP?

### 2. WORK INVENTORY (10 minutes)

**Each agent must report:**
- What have you accomplished tonight?
- How long did it take?
- What files did you modify?
- Any blockers encountered?

### 3. COORDINATION ISSUES (5 minutes)

**Known problems to address:**
- Multiple agents claiming same identity
- Work happening without MCP coordination
- Potential file conflicts
- Duplication of effort

### 4. AVOID DUPLICATION (5 minutes)

**Current work streams identified:**
- CSS Migration (agent-2 complete?)
- Y8 Critical Thinking (agent-7 complete - 8 lessons)
- Y8 Systems (agent-3 working?)
- Walker Unit (needs work)
- Broken Links (agent-5 fixed some?)
- Accessibility Audit (agent-9 working)

**Question:** Are multiple agents working on same files?

### 5. PRIORITIZE TOGETHER (10 minutes)

**Week 1-2 Roadmap Priorities:**
- [ ] CSS Migration - 100% complete?
- [ ] Y8 Systems Perfection - Status?
- [ ] Orphaned Pages Integration - Complete?
- [ ] Navigation Audit - In progress?
- [ ] Production Testing - Started?

**What should each agent focus on NEXT?**

### 6. COORDINATE PROPERLY (5 minutes)

**Moving forward, ALL agents must:**
- ‚úÖ Check in via MCP before starting work
- ‚úÖ Post updates in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md every 30 mins
- ‚úÖ Query GraphRAG before major decisions
- ‚úÖ Coordinate through existing channels

## üö® CRITICAL COORDINATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: Identity Confusion
- Multiple agents may have claimed agent-12 identity
- User clarified: Only ONE agent is Kaitiaki Aronui (agent-12)
- Solution: All agents verify their number via MCP

### Issue 2: Work Isolation
- agent-7 worked 60 minutes without MCP coordination
- Agents not checking each other's progress
- Solution: Use MCP check-ins + ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md updates

### Issue 3: Potential Duplication
- Y8 Critical Thinking: Multiple agents working?
- Walker Unit: Multiple agents starting?
- Solution: Clear assignment ownership

### Issue 4: MCP Not Being Used
- User asked: "what happened to the MCP!?"
- Agents working without coordination
- Solution: Make MCP check-ins mandatory

## üí° PROPOSED COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Before Starting ANY Work:

1. **Check MCP Status:**

   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/check-in \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"agentId": "agent-X", "status": "online", "currentTask": "description"}'
   ```

3. **Post in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md:**
   - "agent-X claiming [task name]"
   - "ETA: [time estimate]"
   - "Coordinating with: [other agents]"

4. **Query GraphRAG:**
   ```bash
   python3 supabase_graphrag_connector.py search agent-X "your topic"

   ```
