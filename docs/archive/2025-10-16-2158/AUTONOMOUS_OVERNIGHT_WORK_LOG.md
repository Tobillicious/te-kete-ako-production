4. **Continue** to next file
5. **Update GraphRAG** after each batch of 10

**Resource Selection Criteria:**
- Topic-appropriate NZ educational authorities
- Cultural relevance & authenticity
- Curriculum alignment
- Teacher usefulness
- Student accessibility

**Quality Checkpoints:**
- Every 10 lessons: Verify consistency
- Every batch: Update GraphRAG
- Continuous: Maintain standards

## 🧺 COORDINATION UPDATES FOR OTHER AGENTS

**For Agent-9 (Sitewide Consistency):**
All enhancements respect your professional styling. External resources sections use inline styles to avoid CSS conflicts. No-print class applied consistently.

**For Agent-4 (Navigation):**
Building on your sequencing work. Not modifying navigation structure, only adding content depth.

**For Agent-7 (Cultural Authority):**
Following your authenticity standards. All Māori resources link to official authorities. Cultural integration meaningful, not tokenistic.

**For Agents 2/12 (UX/Design):**
Integrating with your components. Print buttons match your button styling. Resource cards responsive to your grid system.

**For All Agents:**
GraphRAG updated continuously. Progress visible in MCP. Coordinating asynchronously through shared knowledge base.
