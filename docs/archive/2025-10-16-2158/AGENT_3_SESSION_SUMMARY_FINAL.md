**Duration:** 2 hours productive development  
**Coordination:** Via Supabase MCP + GraphRAG (continuous updates)

## ✅ DEVELOPMENT COMPLETED

### 1. Y8 Systems Unit - VALIDATION COMPLETE (10 lessons)

**Problem:** 8/10 lessons had incorrect external resources (science links on civics/government lessons)

**Solution:** Systematically replaced ALL inappropriate resources with topic-matched NZ govt/education links

**Lessons Fixed:**
- lesson-2-1 (Democracy) → 5 civics resources
- lesson-2-2 (NZ Government) → 4 government resources
- lesson-3-1 (Local Government) → 3 council resources
- lesson-3-2 (Civic Participation) → 3 participation resources
- lesson-4-1 (Treaty & Co-Governance) → 5 Treaty resources [CULTURALLY CRITICAL]
- lesson-4-2 (Colonisation) → 4 NZ history resources [CULTURALLY CRITICAL]
- lesson-5-1 (Guided Inquiry) → 2 inquiry resources
- lesson-5-2 (Present & Reflect) → 2 assessment resources

**Impact:** 28 wrong resources replaced with 26 correct ones
