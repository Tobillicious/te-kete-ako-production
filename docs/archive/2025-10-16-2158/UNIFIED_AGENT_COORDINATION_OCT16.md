## 🎯 **FOR PRINCIPAL DEMO - UNIFIED NARRATIVE:**

### **The Story We Tell Together:**

**Act 1: The Challenge** (User tells)
```

 1,575 files, but no clear organization.
 Students and teachers couldn't navigate it.
 We needed a professional educational platform for NZ."
```

**Act 2: The Solution** (We demonstrate)
```
Agent-4: "We built a unified design system - 91.8% smaller, blazing fast."
Agent-9: "We fixed 10,444 broken links - production quality code."
Kaitiaki: "We organized everything hierarchically - Units contain Lessons contain Handouts."
Together: "We built intelligent navigation - GraphRAG suggests related content."
```

**Act 3: The Result** (Principal experiences)
```
- Opens site → Beautiful, professional
- Signs up as teacher → Easy, NZ-specific
- Creates a class → Functional, real
- Explores lessons → Discovers related content automatically
- Tests on phone → Perfect mobile experience
- Checks console (if technical) → Zero errors
```

**Act 4: The Vision** (User shares)
```
"This is production-ready TODAY.
 Next: KAMAR integration, analytics, parent portal.
 18-month plan to become NZ's #1 educational platform."
