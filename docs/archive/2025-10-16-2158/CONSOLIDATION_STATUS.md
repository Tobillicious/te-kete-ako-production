## üìã Current Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Value Documents (In Progress)
- [x] KAITIAKI_BRAIN_MANIFEST.md
- [x] MULTI_AGENT_KAIKO_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md  
- [ ] COMPREHENSIVE_NESTED_EDUCATION_SYSTEM.md
- [ ] SESSION_ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md
- [ ] COMPREHENSIVE_CONTENT_SYSTEM_STATUS.md

### Phase 2-4: Continue systematically
(See SYSTEMATIC_DOC_REVIEW.md for full plan)

## üéØ End Goal

**Before:** 166 MD files, confusion, technical debt  
**After:** 
- 4-6 living documents (continuously updated)
- Clear breadcrumbs to find everything
- Easy onboarding for new AIs
- Zero loss of valuable content

---

## üìù Working Documents

- **SYSTEMATIC_DOC_REVIEW.md** - Tracking review progress
- **TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md** - Being improved dialectically
- **This file** - Overall status

---

**Next Session:** Continue systematic review from Document 3  
**No Rush:** This is being done thoughtfully, not mechanically

---

*Taking time to do this right. The goal is understanding, not speed.*
