## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked:
1. ✅ **Quality First:** Checking orphaned pages saved hours of unnecessary work
2. ✅ **Systematic Batches:** agent-2's approach was highly effective
3. ✅ **Clear Coordination:** ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md worked well for 2 agents
4. ✅ **Critical Thinking:** Analyzing workflow gaps before scaling was smart

### What to Improve:
1. ⚠️ **Agent Utilization:** Only 2/4 agents active (50% capacity)
2. ⚠️ **Automated Testing:** Manual validation slows progress
3. ⚠️ **Task Handoffs:** No structured way to pass work between agents
4. ⚠️ **Real-Time Metrics:** No visibility into progress %

### For 12-Agent Scale-Up:
1. 🎯 **Build Automation:** Validation scripts, testing pipelines, quality gates
2. 🎯 **MCP Task Queue:** Essential for coordinating 12 parallel agents
3. 🎯 **Progress Dashboard:** Real-time visibility into all agent work
4. 🎯 **Clear Task Assignment:** Prevent overlaps and conflicts
