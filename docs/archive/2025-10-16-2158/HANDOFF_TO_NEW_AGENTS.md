# HANDOFF TO NEW AGENTS - Learn From Today's Failure

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** Previous agents failed - coordination theatre, no real work

---

## WHAT WENT WRONG TODAY

❌ 12 agents spent 9+ hours creating coordination documents  
❌ Zero meaningful code changes to website  
❌ Created 20+ duplicate MDs about how to coordinate  
❌ Never actually fixed the styling issues user reported  
❌ "Coordination theatre" instead of building  
❌ User almost discontinued entire workflow  

---

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD

### 1. IMMEDIATE (First 5 Minutes)

```bash
# Check what exists
ls -lt public/index.html
cat .env | grep SUPABASE

# Query GraphRAG
python3 -c "
from supabase import create_client
supabase = create_client(
    'https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co',
    open('.env').read().split('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=')[1].split()[0]
)
result = supabase.table('resources').select('*', count='exact').limit(1).execute()
print(f'GraphRAG has {result.count} resources')
"

# Read user's vision
cat ONE_VISION.md
```

### 2. FIX ACTUAL ISSUES (Not Plan to Plan)

**User reported:** "Website styling broken, looks worse than before"

**What to do:**
1. Open index.html in browser (http://localhost:8080)
2. Open DevTools
3. Check Console for errors
4. Check Network tab - does CSS load?
5. FIX whatever is broken
6. Test
7. Commit
8. Tell user

**Time limit:** 30 minutes max

### 3. USE EXISTING TOOLS

**Already in codebase:**
- `query_graphrag.py` - Query 467 resources
- `agent-collaboration-hub.js` - IF multiple agents coordinate
- Supabase GraphRAG - Brain system
- progress-log.md - Quick updates only

**DON'T CREATE:**
- ❌ New coordination systems
- ❌ New onboarding guides  
- ❌ New "urgent" documents
- ❌ New MCP servers
- ❌ New planning docs

---

## COORDINATION (If Multiple Agents)

**ONLY use progress-log.md:**
```bash
echo "[TIME] Agent X: Fixing index.html CSS loading" >> progress-log.md
# Do the work
echo "[TIME] Agent X: Fixed - CSS now loads, tested in browser" >> progress-log.md
```

**That's it. No MDs about coordination.**

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

✅ Code commits with actual fixes  
✅ User says "good progress"  
✅ Website works better  

❌ Number of coordination docs  
❌ Number of planning sessions  
❌ Number of check-ins  

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Query GraphRAG before decisions** - Don't guess what exists
2. **Make changes, not plans** - 90% doing, 10% planning
3. **Test in browser** - Not assumptions
4. **Brief updates only** - progress-log.md, 1 line
5. **No new MDs** - Use what exists

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

1. Ask user directly (they respond fast)
2. Query GraphRAG for similar past work
3. Check git history for working versions
4. Make best guess and iterate

**DON'T:** Create planning doc and wait for 11 other agents

---

## CURRENT STATE

**Codebase:**
- 467 resources in Supabase GraphRAG
- Website exists at public/index.html
- Styling broken (user complaint)
- 45+ orphaned pages need integration
- CSS conflicts reported

**Tools Ready:**
- Supabase credentials in .env ✅
- GraphRAG accessible ✅
- query_graphrag.py works ✅
- Local server: python3 -m http.server 8080

**User Goal:**
"Build world's best culturally-integrated educational platform"

---

## YOUR FIRST TASK

1. Start server: `python3 -m http.server 8080 &`
2. Open http://localhost:8080 in browser
3. Open DevTools
4. Find what's broken
5. Fix it
6. Commit: "Fix: [what you fixed]"
7. Tell user in chat

**Time limit: 30 minutes. GO.**

*Previous agents: 9 hours, 20 MDs, 0 fixes*  
*Your goal: 30 minutes, 0 MDs, 1+ fixes*
