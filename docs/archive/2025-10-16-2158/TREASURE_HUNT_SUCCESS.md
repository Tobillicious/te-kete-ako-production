"Oh! This is organized by year level.
 Y8 Systems... 10 lessons in sequence.
 Each lesson shows related content.
 I can see the whole curriculum pathway.
 This is EASY to navigate!
 Teachers will love this!"
```

### **Demo Script Update:**
```
1. Show Y8 Systems unit index
   → "Complete 5-week unit, 10 lessons"
