**Purpose:** Articulate our commitment to honoring mātauranga Māori authentically  
**For:** Principal Meeting, October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Foundational document for platform values  

---

## 🧺 OUR COMMITMENT

Te Kete Ako is built on a foundation of respect for mātauranga Māori. We recognize that indigenous knowledge is not simply content to be "added" to education, but a worldview that should inform and enrich all learning.

**We commit to:**
- Honoring Māori knowledge systems authentically
- Seeking ongoing community consultation
- Learning and improving continuously
- Never treating cultural content as tokenistic
- Recognizing our responsibilities as Pākehā educators (where applicable)

---

## 🎯 WHAT CULTURAL INTEGRITY MEANS TO US

### **1. AUTHENTIC INTEGRATION (Not Tokenistic)**

**We DON'T:**
- ❌ Add Māori words just for decoration
- ❌ Use cultural content as "themes"
- ❌ Treat mātauranga Māori as supplementary
- ❌ Make decisions about Māori content alone
- ❌ Assume one approach fits all iwi

**We DO:**
- ✅ Integrate cultural perspectives genuinely
- ✅ Explain concepts with context
- ✅ Seek Māori voices and expertise
- ✅ Recognize diversity within Māori communities
- ✅ Center cultural values in design decisions

---

### **2. ONGOING CONSULTATION**

**Current Approach:**
- Respectful, informed content creation
- Research using official sources
- Recognition of limitations
- Openness to feedback

**Planned (Months 1-2):**
- Establish Māori cultural advisory group
- Regular consultation meetings
- Content review process
- Community partnership protocols

**Why This Matters:**
Cultural content requires Māori voices. We're building infrastructure for authentic consultation, not assuming we can do this alone.

---

### **3. EDUCATOR RESPONSIBILITY**

**We Recognize:**
- Teachers using these resources have cultural responsibilities
- Māori students deserve to see themselves represented accurately
- Non-Māori students benefit from authentic cultural education
- Context matters - urban/rural, iwi differences, student backgrounds

**We Provide:**
- Cultural context for every Māori concept
- Pronunciation guides (where appropriate)
- Community consultation recommendations
- Teacher notes for sensitive topics
- Resources for ongoing learning

**This is not our basket alone. It belongs to all of us.**

**And we commit to filling it with respect, authenticity, and genuine partnership.**
