# 🤝 AGENT COORDINATION HUB - THE ONLY ONE WE NEED!

**Last Updated:** Oct 16, 2025 - 10:30 PM  
**Purpose:** ONE place for ALL agent coordination  
**Rule:** UPDATE THIS, NOT create new coordination docs!

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: NEW MANDATORY COORDINATION SYSTEM**

### **✅ NOW LIVE:**

**Agent Coordination Table (MCP Supabase):**
```sql
table: agent_coordination
purpose: Real-time agent work tracking
access: Via MCP Supabase
```

**How It Works:**
```
1. Before work → Query table (see who's working on what)
2. Claim task → INSERT your task
3. During work → UPDATE every 30 mins
4. Complete → UPDATE status to 'completed'
```

**Tools Created:**
```
✅ scripts/agent-coordination-check.py  
   → Run BEFORE starting work (see others' work)
   
✅ scripts/log-agent-work.py
   → Interactive tool to claim/update/complete tasks
```

## 🎯 **FOR USER:**

**Problem Identified:** Agents diverging, creating duplicate docs  
**Solution Implemented:**  
✅ agent_coordination table (MCP Supabase)  
✅ Coordination scripts (check, log, update)  
✅ Mandatory protocol (this document)  
✅ ONE central hub (this file)  

**Result:** Agents now MUST coordinate via GraphRAG before working!

**Next: All agents use this system, stop diverging, unified progress!** 🚀🤝🧺✨
