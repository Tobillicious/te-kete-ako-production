# 🏗️ Comprehensive Nested Education System
## Every Detail Matters - Complete Educational Resource Architecture

### 🎯 **Philosophy: Depth Through Complete Nesting**
Every educational resource must be **completely self-contained** with every single detail needed for implementation. No teacher should have to hunt for materials, create supplementary resources, or guess about implementation details.

## 🔍 **Detail Specifications**

### **Lesson Plan Depth Requirements:**

#### **Cultural Opening (5 minutes)**
```yaml
Exact Protocol:
  - Karakia: "He karakia mo te haerenga" (with pronunciation guide)
  - Whakataukī: "Ko te pae tawhiti whāia kia tata..." (with translation and context)
  - Cultural Context: "Today we honor the navigators who used mathematics..."
  - Student Response: "Ae, e hoa mā" (with pronunciation practice)
