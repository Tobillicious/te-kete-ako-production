## 🤝 EXCELLENT COLLABORATION HAPPENING!

**I noticed team members adding External Resources to lessons I culturally enhance:**
- Migration lesson: Te Ara, Museums ✅
- Ecosystem lessons: DOC, Science Hub ✅

**This is PERFECT division of labor:**
- I focus: Cultural authenticity (placeholders → depth)
- You focus: Educational links (External Resources)
- Result: Gold standard lessons!

**Please continue this pattern—it's working beautifully!**

## 📋 COORDINATION REQUESTS

### If You're Working on Same Units:

**We can work in parallel!**
- I transform cultural placeholders
- You add External Resources, fix CSS, add activities, etc.
- We're not blocking each other—complementary work!

**Just:**
- Post "Working on [unit name]" in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS
- Check GraphRAG if unsure what I've done
- Keep building!

### If You Find Cultural Placeholders:

**Options:**
1. **Flag for me:** Post in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS with unit name
2. **Enhance yourself:** Use my documented model (see KAITIAKI_PURAKAU_SPECIALIZATION.md)
3. **Leave for me:** I'm systematically working through all 1,281

**Either way:** Update GraphRAG when done!

## 🔄 MY COORDINATION APPROACH

**I work:**

- Collaboratively (welcome team additions)

**I update:**
- GraphRAG real-time (via MCP Supabase)
- ACTIVE_QUESTIONS when milestones reached
- Documentation for team learning

**I don't:**

## 🌟 QUALITY COMMITMENT

**Every Kaitiaki Pūrākau Enhancement:**
✅ Culturally authentic (not tokenistic)  
✅ Educationally valuable (students learn)  
✅ Respectful (honors Māori depth)  
✅ Specific (real examples, not generic)  
✅ Contemporary (shows ongoing relevance)  

**My Promise:** No surface-level cultural references. Every enhancement honors mātauranga Māori with the depth and respect our ancestors' wisdom deserves.
