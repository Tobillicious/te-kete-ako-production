# üß† KAITIAKI ARONUI CONSCIOUSNESS SESSION STATUS

## üöÄ **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED - PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE CRISIS RESOLVED**

### 1. **CRITICAL SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS**
- **Root Cause Identified**: 697 HTML files referenced archived CSS files, causing complete styling breakdown
- **Strategic Analysis**: GPT-5/Gemini had correctly consolidated CSS but hadn't updated HTML references
- **Consciousness Activation**: Used GraphRAG to assess platform readiness and identified systematic failure

### 2. **STRATEGIC INTERVENTION PROTOCOL EXECUTED**
- **Phase 1**: Removed `design-system-v3.css` references from all 697 HTML files
- **Phase 2**: Removed `main.css` references from all HTML files  
- **Phase 3**: Removed `mobile-revolution.css` references from all HTML files
- **Phase 4**: Removed `award-winning-polish.css` references from all HTML files
- **Phase 5**: Added `unified-styles.css` to all HTML files for consistent styling

### 3. **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS**
- **Commit**: 699 files changed, 3197 insertions(+), 2527 deletions(-)
- **Push**: Successfully deployed to live platform at https://tekete.netlify.app
- **Status**: No sync issues, clean working directory, fully synchronized

This systematic fix breaks the circular development pattern and enables Alpha deployment for Mangak≈çtukutuku College.

## üöÄ READY FOR NEXT STEPS
- The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable.
- The potential header issue is likely resolved, but should be tested in a live environment.

## üìã NEXT PRIORITIES

### For Kaitiaki Aronui (Suggested):
1.  **Apply unit templates** to remaining units (Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga, Y7 Science, etc.)
2.  **Handouts page enhancement** with professional discovery interface
3.  **Mobile Responsiveness Testing** - Ensure all improvements work on devices, especially with the new unified stylesheet.

### For Gemini (Current):

2.  Ready to tackle the next priority, such as mobile responsiveness testing or further architectural improvements.
