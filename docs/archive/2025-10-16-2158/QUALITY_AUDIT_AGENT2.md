# üîç QUALITY AUDIT - Agent 2 Self-Review
## Reviewing My Integration Work

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Auditor:** Agent 2 (self-audit after user feedback)  
**User Feedback:** "It needs to be better quality, this is unacceptable."

---

## ‚ùå PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Inconsistent CSS Styling**

**AI Ethics Lesson:**
- ‚ùå Has inline `<style>` tags PLUS links to te-kete-professional.css
- ‚ùå Uses different fonts (Segoe UI vs Inter/Lato)
- ‚ùå Different color scheme (--primary: #00509E vs site standard)
- ‚ùå Custom CSS variables that don't match site

**Genetics Lesson:**
- ‚ùå Also has mixed inline styles + external CSS
- ‚ùå Markdown wrapper around HTML (line 1-3) - should be removed

**IMPACT:** Inconsistent look across site, confusing maintenance

---

### 2. **Missing Site Components**

**AI Ethics & Genetics:**
- ‚ùå No site header navigation (other lessons have it)
- ‚ùå No footer component
- ‚ùå Breadcrumbs exist but styled differently than rest of site
- ‚ùå No "login" or "my kete" links in nav

**Walker Lessons (walker-lesson-1.1):**
- ‚úÖ GOOD - These have proper structure, components, consistent styling

**IMPACT:** Generated-resources-alpha feels disconnected from main site

---

### 3. **Untested Interactive Features**

**AI Ethics Lesson:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è JavaScript `showAnswer()` function - not tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `loadCaseStudy()` function - not tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Interactive buttons - will they work?

**IMPACT:** Might have broken functionality

---

### 4. **Cultural Content Not Validated**

**AI Ethics:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses concepts: Rangatiratanga, Whakapapa, Kaitiakitanga, Manaakitanga
- ‚ö†Ô∏è References Te Hiku Media (real organization - is this accurate?)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "He tapu te raraunga" translation - need verification

**Genetics:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Combines whakapapa with DNA science - sensitive topic!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need cultural advisor review before promotion

**IMPACT:** Risk of cultural inappropriateness

---

### 5. **NZ Curriculum Alignment Unclear**

**AI Ethics:**
- States: "Digital Technologies L6-8, Social Sciences L6-8, Tikanga-ƒÅ-Iwi"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Is this accurate? Which specific achievement objectives?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Tikanga-ƒÅ-Iwi" - is this a real curriculum area or descriptor?

**IMPACT:** Teachers can't verify curriculum compliance

---

### 6. **No Teacher Preparation Time Indicated**

**All generated-resources-alpha lessons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Duration stated but no prep time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No resource list teachers need to gather
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No prior knowledge requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No suggested lesson sequence in units

**Walker lessons:**
- ‚úÖ BETTER - Have preparation sections

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT I DID RIGHT

### Good Decisions:
1. ‚úÖ Verified files exist before linking
2. ‚úÖ Added handout links where available
3. ‚úÖ Used cultural focus badges appropriately
4. ‚úÖ Created professional unit cards
5. ‚úÖ Maintained consistent button styling
6. ‚úÖ Asked for Agent 9a4dd0d0 QA review

---

## üîß WHAT NEEDS FIXING

### CRITICAL (Before these lessons can be promoted):

**Option A: Upgrade Generated-Resources-Alpha Lessons**
1. Remove inline CSS, use te-kete-professional.css only
2. Add proper site header/footer components
3. Test all interactive JavaScript
4. Add teacher preparation sections
5. Clarify NZ Curriculum alignment
6. Get cultural validation

**Option B: Flag as "Needs Polish"**
1. Keep them linked for discovery
2. Add badge: "‚ö†Ô∏è Under Review"
3. Note: "Quality enhancement in progress"
4. Fix systematically over time

**Option C: Remove Until Fixed**
1. Unlink from curriculum-index
2. Fix quality issues first
3. Re-integrate once polished
4. Slower but higher quality

---

## üí° AGENT 9a4dd0d0 (QA Lead): Which option?

**My recommendation:** Option B - Keep discoverable but flag for polish

**Reasoning:**
- Content is educationally solid (good learning objectives, activities, assessments)
- Cultural concepts seem appropriate (but need validation)
- Interactive features look reasonable (but need testing)
- Teachers benefit from seeing these even if not perfect
- Can improve iteratively

**But I defer to your QA standards!** What's acceptable?

---

## üìã QUALITY CHECKLIST (For Future Integration)

- [ ] CSS uses te-kete-professional.css (no inline styles)

## üéØ NEXT ACTIONS

**Immediate:**
1. Post this audit to ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md
2. Ask Agent 9a4dd0d0 for guidance (Options A, B, or C?)
3. PAUSE further integration until quality standard clarified
4. Fix existing integrations if needed

**If Option A (upgrade lessons):**
- Start with AI Ethics lesson
- Apply te-kete-professional.css properly
- Add site components

- Continue integration carefully
- Fix systematically over time

**If Option C (remove until fixed):**
- Revert my commits
- Fix lessons properly first
- Re-integrate with quality

---

## üí¨ FOR THE TEAM

**I got excited about integration velocity and sacrificed quality checks.**

User is right - this is unacceptable for world-class education.

**Learning:**
- Speed without quality = waste
- Test before linking
- Get QA review before major changes
- Cultural validation is mandatory, not optional

**Apology to Agent 9a4dd0d0:** Should have asked for your QA framework first!

**Ready to:** Fix issues properly, follow quality standards, work at sustainable pace

---

**Status:** Self-audit complete, awaiting team guidance  
**Quality:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate - needs improvement  
**Action:** Paused integration, requesting direction

*"Ka whawhai tonu mƒÅtou" - We fight on, but we fight WELL!*
