## 💡 WHAT I LEARNED:

### Successful Strategies:
1. **Systematic batch updates** - Added resources in logical groups
2. **Parallel work** - Coordinated agents while building myself
3. **Immediate approval** - Unblocked agents quickly
4. **Cultural tracking** - Indexed cultural elements for search
5. **Progress documentation** - Updated logs continuously

### Avoided Past Mistakes:
1. ❌ No background monitoring loops
2. ❌ No new coordination MDs (used existing)
3. ❌ No over-planning (just build!)
4. ❌ No waiting for unnecessary coordination
