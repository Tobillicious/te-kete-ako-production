# CSS CONFLICT ROOT CAUSE FOUND

**User feedback:** "website seems worse, like there are css conflict or something"

## THE ACTUAL PROBLEM

**Production CSS ≠ Local CSS**

### Production (`tekete.netlify.app/css/te-kete-professional.css`):
```
TE KETE AKO PROFESSIONAL DESIGN SYSTEM V1.0
"Professional Excellence with Cultural Authenticity"
Clean • Fast • Accessible • Culturally Integrated
```

### Local (`public/css/te-kete-professional.css`):
```
TE KETE AKO - PROFESSIONAL DESIGN SYSTEM
Enhanced with NZ Cultural Integration and Modern Pedagogy
```

**These are TWO DIFFERENT FILES!**

## Impact

- Users see production CSS (V1.0) 
- But HTML expects local CSS (Enhanced version)
- Variables don't match
- Styles conflict
- Website looks broken

## Solution

**Option A:** Push local CSS to production (if it's better)
**Option B:** Update local HTML to work with production CSS (V1.0)
**Option C:** Find which CSS version is actually good and use that everywhere

## GraphRAG Fixed ✅

Commit cc625a72 - GraphRAG now working (fixed KeyError)

## Next Steps

1. Determine which CSS is the "good" one
2. Make local match production OR vice versa
3. Test locally before pushing
4. Stop making coordination files, FIX ACTUAL PROBLEMS
