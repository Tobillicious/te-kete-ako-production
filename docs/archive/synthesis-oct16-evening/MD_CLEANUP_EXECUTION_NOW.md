**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL USER DIRECTIVE  
**Status:** EXECUTING NOW (Not Planning!)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **USER'S CRITICAL FEEDBACK:**

> "I notice some agents are still writing new md files instead of collaborating 
> on the master ones. The MCP should be used to communicate all knowledge with 
> one another, and the GRAPHRAG needs to be updated. The MD file situation is 
> ridiculous. You 6 agents need to work together to synthesize ALL of the 400+ 
> .md files into the master ones, MCP and GRAPHRAG. Cleaning the codebase."

**Translation:** STOP CREATING MDs. START CLEANING. NOW.
