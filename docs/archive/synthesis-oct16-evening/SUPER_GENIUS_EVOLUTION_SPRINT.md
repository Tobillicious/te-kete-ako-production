## 🧠 **SUPER GENIUS FEATURES (Priority Order):**

### **Feature 1: AI Learning Pathways** ⭐⭐⭐
**What:** Personalized learning journey for each student

**How It Works:**
```
Student Profile:
├─ Year level: 10
├─ Cultural identity: Māori (Ngāpuhi)
├─ Preferred language: Both
├─ Current progress: 23 resources completed
└─ Strengths/weaknesses: Strong in science, needs support in math

AI Algorithm (GraphRAG + Logic):
├─ Query similar students' successful paths
├─ Match cultural background to relevant content
├─ Identify prerequisite knowledge gaps
├─ Suggest optimal next 5 resources
├─ Adapt based on progress
└─ Balance challenge vs. support

Student Sees:
"Your Personalized Pathway:"
1. Y10 Math: Algebra through Māori Games (matches culture + fills gap)
2. Y10 Science: Ecology & Kaitiakitanga (builds on strength)
3. STEM Careers for Māori (motivational, cultural)
4. Y10 Statistics: Census Data (prerequisite for NCEA)
5. NCEA Level 1 Prep (goal-oriented)
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// /js/ai-learning-pathways.js
async function generatePersonalizedPathway(studentProfile) {
    // Query GraphRAG for:
    // 1. Resources matching year level
    // 2. Cultural identity alignment
    // 3. Subject area needs
    // 4. Difficulty progression
    
    const pathway = await supabase.rpc('generate_learning_pathway', {
        year_level: studentProfile.year_level,
        cultural_bg: studentProfile.cultural_identity,
        completed: studentProfile.completed_resources,
        strengths: studentProfile.strengths,
        goals: studentProfile.goals
    });
    
    return pathway; // Returns ordered list of 10 next resources
}
```

**Database Function:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_learning_pathway(
    year_level integer,
    cultural_bg text[],
    completed uuid[],
    strengths text[],
    goals text[]
) RETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$
    -- Complex algorithm using GraphRAG data
    -- Scores resources by:
    -- - Relevance to year level (weight: 0.3)
    -- - Cultural match (weight: 0.25)
    -- - Difficulty progression (weight: 0.2)
    -- - Subject balance (weight: 0.15)
    -- - Goal alignment (weight: 0.1)
$$;
```

**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Impact:** REVOLUTIONARY (personalized education!)  
**Agents Needed:** 2 (one backend, one frontend)

def analyze_student_risk(student_id):
    # Get student progress over time
    progress = query_student_progress(student_id, last_30_days=True)
    
    # Calculate trends
    velocity = calculate_velocity(progress)  # Resources/week
    engagement = calculate_engagement(progress)  # Time spent
    completion_rate = calculate_completion(progress)  # Finish rate
    
    # ML model (simple linear regression to start)
    risk_score = ml_model.predict([velocity, engagement, completion_rate])
    
    # If risk_score > 0.7 → Alert teacher
    # If risk_score < 0.3 → Celebrate success
    
    # Generate culturally-aware recommendations
    recommendations = match_to_cultural_profile(student_id, risk_score)
    
    return {
        'risk_level': risk_score,

    completion_rate = calculate_overall_completion(progress)  # 20% weight
    cultural_engagement = calculate_cultural_engagement(progress)  # 10% weight
    time_management = calculate_consistency(progress)  # 10% weight
    
    # Predict readiness (0-100%)
    ncea_readiness = (
        literacy_score * 0.3 +
        numeracy_score * 0.3 +
        completion_rate * 0.2 +
        cultural_engagement * 0.1 +
        time_management * 0.1
    )
    
    # Recommendations
    if ncea_readiness < 60:
        gaps = identify_gaps([literacy_score, numeracy_score])
        recommendations = generate_catch_up_plan(gaps)
    elif ncea_readiness > 85:
        recommendations = generate_excellence_pathway()
    else:
        recommendations = generate_consolidation_plan()
    
    return {
        'readiness': ncea_readiness,
        'literacy': literacy_score,
        'numeracy': numeracy_score,
