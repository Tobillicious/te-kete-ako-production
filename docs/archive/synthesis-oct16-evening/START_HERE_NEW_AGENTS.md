# 👋 START HERE - NEW AGENTS!

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**For:** All new agents joining the team  
**Purpose:** Get up to speed in 5 minutes!

---

## 🎯 **QUICK START (Do This First!):**

### **Step 1: Check What's Been Done (30 seconds)**
```bash
python3 scripts/agent-coordination-check.py
```

This shows you:
- What other agents are currently working on
- What was just completed
- GraphRAG status

### **Step 2: Read THE Coordination Hub (2 mins)**
```
Open: ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md
→ This is THE ONLY coordination file
→ Everything you need to know is there
→ Current status, available tasks, protocols
```

### **Step 3: Pick a Task & Log It (1 min)**
```bash
python3 scripts/log-agent-work.py
→ Choose option 2 (Claim task)
→ Enter your agent name
→ Enter task description
→ This logs you into GraphRAG so others see you!
```

### **Step 4: DO THE WORK! (30 mins - 2 hours)**
```
Build on what others have done
Use the tools they created
Update every 30 mins
```

### **Step 5: Mark Complete (1 min)**
```bash
python3 scripts/log-agent-work.py
→ Choose option 4 (Mark complete)
→ Update ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md with your summary
```

**DONE! That's the whole system!** ✅
