# üß∫ CRITICAL: 373 Untracked Changes Need Review
**Date:** July 31, 2025 23:57  
**Urgent Priority:** High  
**Context:** Claude Code session ended with 373 untracked items in source control

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **The Problem:**
Screenshot shows **373 untracked changes** in source control that need systematic review. These contain recent work from the past few days that wasn't syncing to live site due to deployment folder confusion (now fixed).

### **What Was Fixed:**
‚úÖ **Deployment sync issue resolved** - netlify.toml now publishes from root  
‚úÖ **GraphRAG updated** - 163 resources, 23 concepts, 503 relationships indexed  
‚úÖ **Authentication migrated** - Firebase ‚Üí Supabase complete  
‚úÖ **Critical security fixes applied** - XSS vulnerabilities eliminated

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP REVIEW PROCESS**

### **1. Examine Untracked Changes**
```bash
# See all untracked files
git status --porcelain

# Count them
git status --porcelain | wc -l

# List by type
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | head -20
```

### **2. Categorize Each Item**
For each untracked file, determine:
- **KEEP & COMMIT**: Valuable new work that should go live
- **STASH**: Development artifacts to keep locally but not commit  
- **DELETE**: Temporary/duplicate files that can be removed

### **3. Priority Categories**
**HIGH PRIORITY (Commit immediately):**
- New lesson content in `lessons/` or `guided-inquiry-unit/`
- Enhanced filtering systems in `js/`
- Cultural authenticity improvements
- Navigation fixes

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Review carefully):**
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes
- Resource additions

**LOW PRIORITY (Consider stashing):**
- Development logs
- Temporary test files
- Backup duplicates

## üõ†Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED COMMANDS**

### **Review and Commit Valuable Work:**
```bash
# Add specific valuable files
git add [filename]

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "RECOVER: [Description of valuable work]

[Details of what was recovered and why it's important]

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to live site
git push origin main
```

### **Stash Development Artifacts:**
```bash
# Create .gitignore entries for development files
echo "development_logs/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.tmp" >> .gitignore

# Or move to backup location
mkdir -p ../te-kete-dev-artifacts
mv [development-files] ../te-kete-dev-artifacts/
```

---

## üß† **GRAPHRAG INTEGRATION**

**CRITICAL**: After committing new content, update GraphRAG:
```bash
# Update knowledge base with new resources
python3 local_knowledge_update.py

# Should show updated counts if new educational content added
# Current: 163 resources, 23 concepts, 503 relationships
```

---

## üìÅ **KEY FILES TO CHECK**

### **Likely High-Value Content:**
- Any files in `lessons/podcast-series/` (mentioned in documentation)
- New interactive tools in `y8-systems/resources/`
- Enhanced filtering systems in `js/`
- Cultural content improvements
- Navigation anchor fixes

### **Files to Preserve Locally (Don't Commit):**
- `.env` (contains credentials - already ignored)
- `public_backup_20250731/` (duplicate content backup)
- Development logs and temporary files

---

## üîÑ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Repository is Clean When:**
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working tree
- [ ] All valuable educational content is committed and live
- [ ] Development artifacts are stashed or ignored appropriately
- [ ] GraphRAG knowledge base reflects any new content additions
- [ ] Live site (https://tekete.netlify.app) shows latest improvements

### **Check Your Work:**
```bash
# Should show minimal/clean output
git status

# Should be current with remote  
git log --oneline -5

# Verify GraphRAG is current
python3 local_knowledge_update.py
```

## ‚ö° **QUICK START**

```bash
# 1. See what we're dealing with
git status

git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | head -10

# 3. Review and commit valuable content systematically
git add [valuable-file]
git commit -m "RECOVER: [description]"

# 4. Update GraphRAG after adding educational content
python3 local_knowledge_update.py

# 5. Push to live site
git push origin main
```

**REMEMBER**: This platform serves Aotearoa New Zealand educators. Every piece of content has cultural significance. When in doubt about cultural authenticity, preserve it for review rather than deleting.

**Kia kaha! The learners are counting on us to get this right.**
