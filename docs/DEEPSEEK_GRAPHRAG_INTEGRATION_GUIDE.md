## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Environment Variables Needed:**

Add these to your Netlify environment variables:

```bash
# Existing (you already have these)
SUPABASE_URL=https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id

# New for DeepSeek integration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
```

### **2. Get DeepSeek API Key:**

1. Go to [DeepSeek API Console](https://platform.deepseek.com)
2. Create account and get API key (env)
3. Add to Netlify environment variables

### **3. Deploy the Supabase Migration:**

```bash
# Run the multi-AI coordination table migration
supabase db push
```

### **4. Test the Integration:**

1. Visit: `your-site.netlify.app/deepseek-graphrag-terminal.html`
2. Try queries like:
   - "How does Te Ao Māori integrate with mathematics?"
   - "Explain systems thinking for Year 8 students"
   - "What are the best digital citizenship resources?"

## 🎭 **How Multi-AI Coordination Works**

### **Phase 1: GraphRAG Brain Query**
```javascript
// DeepSeek queries GraphRAG for institutional memory
const context = await queryGraphRAGBrain(userQuery);
// Returns: relevant resources, cultural context, relationships
```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced DeepSeek Reasoning**
```javascript
// DeepSeek receives GraphRAG context + user query
const response = await queryDeepSeek(query, graphragContext);
// Returns: Culturally-aware, educationally-grounded response
```

### **Phase 3: Coordination Logging**
```javascript
// System logs multi-AI interaction for analytics
await logMultiAIInteraction(user, query, context, response);
// Tracks: success, performance, cultural safety
```

## 🌟 **Key Features**

### **🧠 Intelligent Coordination**
- DeepSeek gets institutional memory from GraphRAG
- Responses grounded in your 179+ educational resources
- Cultural safety automatically triggered for Te Ao Māori content

### **📊 Real-Time Analytics**
- Track multi-AI coordination success
- Monitor GraphRAG brain utilization
- Cultural resource access patterns
- Performance metrics

### **🛡️ Cultural Safety**
- Automatic detection of cultural content
- Enhanced context for authentic representation
- Te Ao Māori resource prioritization

### **⚡ Performance Features**
- Graceful fallback (DeepSeek works without GraphRAG)
- Caching and optimization
- Real-time coordination monitoring

## 🎯 **Example Queries That Showcase the Power**

### **1. Cultural Integration Query:**
```
"How can I teach probability using Māori traditional knowledge?"
```
**Result**: DeepSeek uses GraphRAG to find "Probability Matauranga Integration" resources, provides culturally-grounded response.

### **2. Systems Thinking Query:**
```
"Explain how government systems connect to economic justice for Year 8 students"
```
**Result**: GraphRAG finds connections between government lessons and economic justice units, DeepSeek synthesizes comprehensive response.

### **3. Resource Discovery Query:**
```
"What's the best way to teach digital citizenship while honoring Te Ao Māori values?"
```
**Result**: Multi-AI coordination finds digital citizenship resources + cultural safety frameworks.
