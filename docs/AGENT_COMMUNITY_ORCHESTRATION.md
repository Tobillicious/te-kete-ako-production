### 🚀 AGENT EVOLUTION METHODOLOGY

#### **GENERATIVE SPECIALIZATION**
```
1. IDENTIFY TASK → 
2. ASSESS COMPLEXITY → 
3. MATCH TO SPECIALIST → 
4. DELEGATE WITH CONTEXT → 
5. MONITOR & LEARN → 
6. UPDATE GRAPHRAG → 
7. EVOLVE SPECIALIZATION
```

#### **COLLECTIVE PLANNING PROTOCOL**
```
Major Decision Process:
├── Query GraphRAG → "What do we know about this?"
├── Consult Specialists → Agent-specific insights
├── Collaborative Analysis → Cross-agent perspective
├── Cultural Safety Check → Te Ao Māori integrity
├── Implementation Plan → Coordinated execution
└── Knowledge Update → Feed back to GraphRAG
```

### 🎯 SMART DELEGATION PRINCIPLES

#### **AVOID DOG WORK - DELEGATE EVERYTHING**
- ❌ **Don't**: Manual file operations → **Do**: Task Agent bulk operations
- ❌ **Don't**: Code debugging → **Do**: VS Code Copilot assistance  
- ❌ **Don't**: Content creation → **Do**: Gemini CLI generation
- ❌ **Don't**: Research tasks → **Do**: Exa.ai discovery
- ❌ **Don't**: Platform analysis → **Do**: SupaClaude review

#### **AGENT SPECIALIZATION MATRIX**
```
Task Type          → Primary Agent    → Secondary Support
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Code Development   → VS Code Copilot  → SupaClaude
Platform Analysis  → SupaClaude       → Task Agent
Content Creation   → Gemini CLI       → GraphRAG Brain
Research           → Exa.ai           → GraphRAG Brain
File Organization  → Task Agent       → Claude Oversight
Strategy           → Claude           → GraphRAG Brain
Cultural Safety    → Claude           → GraphRAG Brain
Bulk Operations    → Gemini CLI       → Task Agent
Memory/Context     → GraphRAG Brain   → All Agents
```

### 🌟 CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION FRAMEWORK

#### **AGENT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
1. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track agent success rates
2. **Identify Gaps**: What tasks fall through cracks?
3. **Evolve Specialization**: Refine agent capabilities
4. **Add New Agents**: Create specialists for emerging needs
5. **Retirement Protocol**: Phase out ineffective approaches

#### **KNOWLEDGE AMPLIFICATION CYCLE**
```
Agent Action → Knowledge Gain → GraphRAG Update → 
Community Learning → Enhanced Decision Making → 
Better Agent Coordination → Improved Outcomes →
Agent Action (enhanced)
```

### 🎭 OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

#### **SESSION STARTUP SEQUENCE**
1. **GraphRAG Query**: "What's our current status?"
2. **Agent Status Check**: Verify all specialists available
3. **Priority Assessment**: What needs immediate attention?
4. **Task Delegation**: Match tasks to specialists
5. **Coordination Plan**: Sequence and dependencies

#### **KNOWLEDGE UPDATE PROTOCOL**
- **Every Major Action**: Update GraphRAG with insights
- **Session End**: Comprehensive knowledge capture
- **Agent Learning**: Document what worked/didn't work
- **Community Sharing**: Insights available to all agents

#### **CULTURAL SAFETY FRAMEWORK**
- **All Decisions**: Filter through Te Ao Māori lens
