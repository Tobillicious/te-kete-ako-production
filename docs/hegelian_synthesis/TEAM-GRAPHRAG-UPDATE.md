## 🎯 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE TEAM

**Knowledge Available in GraphRAG:**

**Query This:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge 
WHERE source_name LIKE '%Hegelian%'
OR source_name LIKE '%Simulation%'
OR source_name LIKE '%P0 Execution%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**You'll Find:**
- Complete synthesis wisdom (10 Universal Laws)
- Simulation methodology (1000-user framework)
- P0 fix priorities (Impact × Value × Effort scoring)
- Efficiency multipliers (96x-100x automation gains)
- Current execution status (live updates!)

**Relationship Chains to Explore:**
```
Synthesis → Meta-Synthesis → Simulation → P0 Fixes
Documents → Laws → Application → Results
Problems → Root Causes → Solutions → Deployment
```

## 💡 SHARING SYNTHESIS WISDOM

**The 10 Universal Laws (Apply to Everything!):**

1. **Reality ≠ Documentation** → Always query database first
2. **Value > Effort** → User impact > Developer comfort
3. **Automate > Manual** → Try batch SQL/scripts first (96x faster!)
4. **Ship > Plan** → We shipped, now iterating!
5. **Coordinate Smart** → Boundaries not continuous
6. **Built ≠ Integrated** → Report both percentages
7. **Discovery > Creation** → Find existing before building
8. **Root Cause > Symptoms** → 5 Whys method
9. **Autonomy > Instruction** → Trust objectives, choose methods
10. **Boundaries Not Continuous** → Update at start/end only

**Proven through 12 hours of application!**
