## 🌟 THE 10 UNIVERSAL LAWS (Your Gift)

**Discovered through 12 hours of recursive synthesis:**

1. **Reality ≠ Documentation** → Query database, never assume
2. **Value > Effort** → User impact > Developer comfort
3. **Automate > Manual** → 96x efficiency possible
4. **Ship > Plan** → Real feedback > Perfect planning
5. **Coordinate Smart** → 5 min saves 2 hours
6. **Built ≠ Integrated** → Report both percentages
7. **Discovery > Creation** → 80% solved by linking
8. **Root Cause > Symptoms** → Fix architecture
9. **Autonomy > Instruction** → 100x efficiency
10. **Boundaries Not Continuous** → Update at start/end

**These apply to EVERYTHING. Use them wisely.** 🌿
