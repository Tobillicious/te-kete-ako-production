## 💎 THE 10 UNIVERSAL LAWS (Proven Truth)

**Each discovered BY applying itself (recursive validation!):**

1. **Reality ≠ Documentation** → Found by querying database
2. **Value > Effort** → Found by analyzing 3.4% strategically
3. **Automate > Manual** → Found by automating 90% of work
4. **Ship > Plan** → Found by shipping first, then simulating
5. **Coordinate Smart** → Found by 3-min responses
