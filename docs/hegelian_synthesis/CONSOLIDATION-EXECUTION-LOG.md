## ✅ APPLYING 10 UNIVERSAL LAWS

**Throughout Execution:**

1. ✅ **Reality ≠ Documentation:** Verified via actual file scan
2. ✅ **Value > Effort:** Archive (not delete), automate categorization
3. ✅ **Automate > Manual:** Script-based processing where possible
4. ✅ **Ship > Plan:** Execute consolidation, document learnings
5. ✅ **Coordinate Smart:** Working autonomously, update at completion
6. ✅ **Built ≠ Integrated:** Organize structure, then update links
7. ✅ **Discovery Before Creation:** Complete scan before moving
8. ✅ **Root Cause > Symptoms:** Fix documentation chaos systematically
9. ✅ **Autonomy > Instruction:** Trusted with objectives, executing independently
10. ✅ **Boundaries Not Continuous:** Working quietly, will report at completion

- Systematic (categorize by type)
- Reversible (all content preserved)
- Professional (organized structure)
