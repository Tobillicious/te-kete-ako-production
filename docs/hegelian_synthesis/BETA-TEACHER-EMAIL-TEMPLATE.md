### Email Body:

```
Kia ora [TEACHER NAME],

I'm reaching out because [PERSONAL CONNECTION: 
- we worked together at [school/event]
- you presented at [conference] on cultural integration
- I've followed your work on [subject/cultural education]
- [mutual friend] suggested you'd be perfect for this
].

I've built Te Kete Ako - an educational platform combining AI intelligence with mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori. Think: 10,000+ quality resources with 75% cultural integration, powered by GraphRAG relationship network.

**The Reality:** It works. The AI is brilliant. The cultural integration is authentic. But I need 5 teachers to use it for ONE WEEK and tell me honestly:
- What actually helps vs what's just clever tech
- What's confusing or frustrating
- Whether it saves time or wastes it
- If you'd actually use this or just be polite about it

**What You Get:**
‚Ä¢ Free lifetime access (worth $X/month when we launch publicly)
‚Ä¢ Direct influence on what gets built next
‚Ä¢ Recognition as founding beta teacher
‚Ä¢ 30-min onboarding call with me (I'll show you everything)
‚Ä¢ My cell number for immediate support all week
‚Ä¢ Honest acknowledgment if it's not for you (no hard feelings!)

**What I Need:**
‚Ä¢ 30 min: Onboarding call (I show you how to use it)
‚Ä¢ 1 week: Use it however you want (1 lesson or 10, your choice)
‚Ä¢ 30 min: Feedback call (brutal honesty about what works/doesn't)
‚Ä¢ Optional: Short testimonial if you genuinely love it

**Why You:**
You understand [cultural integration/subject teaching/student engagement] and won't just be nice - you'll tell me if it's actually useful or if I'm wasting everyone's time.

**Next Steps:**
1. Browse without login: https://tekete.netlify.app (see if it's even worth your time)
2. Reply "Interested" or "Not for me" (both honest answers!)
3. If interested: I'll send login details + calendar link for onboarding

**Full Transparency:**
- This is beta (some pages still being polished)
- GraphRAG features just unlocked this week
- You might find bugs (please do! That's the point)
- I'm a solo developer + AI team, not a company
- No pressure, no strings, just honest feedback

Interested? Or does this sound like more work than value?

NgƒÅ mihi,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR CONTACT]

P.S. The platform has:
- 10,471 active resources
- 1.18 million AI relationships
- 76.6% gold standard quality
- 75.75% cultural integration (whakataukƒ´, te reo, tikanga)
- Perfect Learning Pathways (AI-sequenced Year 7-13)
- Intelligence Hub (GraphRAG-powered discovery)

But honestly? Browse it yourself first. If it doesn't wow you in 5 minutes, it's not worth your week.
