## 🔍 **HOW TO FIND ARCHIVED KNOWLEDGE**

### **Option 1: Query agent_knowledge Table**

```sql
-- Find knowledge by topic
SELECT source_name, doc_type, key_insights, created_at
FROM agent_knowledge
WHERE source_name ILIKE '%[topic]%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Find knowledge by agent
SELECT source_name, doc_type, key_insights
FROM agent_knowledge
WHERE agents_involved @> ARRAY['[agent-name]'];

-- Find knowledge by type
SELECT source_name, doc_type, COUNT(*) as entries
FROM agent_knowledge
GROUP BY source_name, doc_type
ORDER BY entries DESC;
```

### **Option 2: Search This Archive**

```bash
# Find docs about a topic
grep -r "topic" docs/archived-planning-mds/oct-2025/

# Find docs by date
find docs/archived-planning-mds/oct-2025/ -name "*OCT25*.md"

# List all completion milestones
ls docs/archived-planning-mds/oct-2025/completion-milestones/
```

### **Option 3: Query GraphRAG**

```sql
-- Find resources with synthesis relationships
SELECT source_path, target_path, relationship_type, confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE relationship_type ILIKE '%synthesis%'
ORDER BY confidence DESC;
```

1. `ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md` - THE coordination file
2. `🚀-PROFESSIONAL-SAAS-TRANSFORMATION.md` - Current strategic pivot
3. `API-KEYS-NEEDED-FOR-SAAS.md` - Actionable next steps
4. `TEAM-ANNOUNCEMENT-CRITICAL-DISCOVERIES.md` - Current findings
5. `README.md` - Platform documentation
6. `GRAPHRAG-API-DOCUMENTATION.md` - API reference
7. `GRAPHRAG-FEATURE-INVENTORY.md` - Feature reference
8. `GRAPHRAG-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference
9. `README-GRAPHRAG-TOOLS.md` - Tools documentation

## 🔗 **RELATIONSHIP PRESERVATION**

All synthesis relationships preserved in GraphRAG:

```sql
SELECT relationship_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type IN (
  'synthesized_from',
  'synthesized_into',
  'synthesizes_thesis',
  'synthesizes_antithesis',
  'strategic_direction',
  'designated_as'
)
GROUP BY relationship_type;
```

Expected results:
- `synthesized_from`: 1.0 confidence
- `synthesized_into`: 1.0 confidence
- `strategic_direction`: Links to ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md

## 🎊 **IMPACT OF ARCHIVAL**

**Before:**
- 1,481 MD files in root
- Unclear which docs were current
- Visual clutter high
- Difficult to find active work

**After:**
- 19 MD files in root (99% reduction!)
- Clear authority (ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md)
- Zero knowledge loss
- Easy to focus on current strategy

**Clean. Clear. Coordinated.** ✨
