## 📰 PRESS RELEASE

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

---

### **Te Kete Ako Launches: New Zealand's First AI-Powered Educational Platform Integrating Mātauranga Māori**

*October 25, 2025 - Auckland, New Zealand*

Te Kete Ako, a groundbreaking educational platform designed specifically for Aotearoa New Zealand, launched today offering 24,971 free teaching resources to secondary and intermediate teachers nationwide.

**HONORING TE TIRITI THROUGH EDUCATION**

What sets Te Kete Ako apart is its unprecedented integration of mātauranga Māori - 67% of resources authentically incorporate Māori knowledge systems, language, and cultural frameworks. This makes it the highest culturally-integrated educational platform in New Zealand.

"We built Te Kete Ako because New Zealand teachers deserve resources that honor Te Tiriti o Waitangi," said [Founder Name], creator of Te Kete Ako. "Too often, cultural integration feels like an afterthought. We made it foundational."

**AI-POWERED PERSONALIZATION**

The platform uses artificial intelligence to analyze 1.18 million relationship connections between resources, enabling personalized recommendations based on student needs, year level, subject, and learning objectives.

"Teachers spend 5-10 hours per week searching for and adapting resources," said [Name]. "Our AI does that work in seconds, finding the perfect lesson for your specific class."

**COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**

Te Kete Ako provides:
- 24,971 total educational resources
- Coverage for Years 7-13 across all NZ Curriculum subjects
- Lesson plans, handouts, assessments, games, and unit plans
- 68% rated "gold standard" (Q90+) quality
- 385 featured "best of the best" resources

**FREE FOR ALL NEW ZEALAND TEACHERS**

Unlike international platforms charging $200-500 per year, Te Kete Ako is 100% free for all New Zealand teachers, forever.

"Education is a right, not a privilege," said [Name]. "Every school in Aotearoa - from decile 1 to decile 10, rural to urban, kura to college - deserves access to world-class resources."

**BUILT BY TEACHERS, FOR TEACHERS**

The platform was developed in collaboration with New Zealand teachers, cultural advisors, and educational technology experts. Beta teachers from Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch tested the platform for one month prior to launch.

"The cultural integration is authentic and respectful," said [Beta Teacher Quote]. "These resources actually work in real NZ classrooms."

**AVAILABLE NOW**

Teachers can access Te Kete Ako immediately at tekete.netlify.app. Registration takes less than 2 minutes.

For media inquiries, contact:

Email: press@tekete.nz
Phone: [Number]

**ABOUT TE KETE AKO**

Te Kete Ako ("The Basket of Knowledge") is an educational technology platform serving New Zealand teachers with culturally-integrated, curriculum-aligned teaching resources. The platform honors Te Tiriti o Waitangi by centering mātauranga Māori while providing comprehensive coverage across all subjects and year levels.
