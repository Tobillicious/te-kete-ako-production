## 🚀 What GraphRAG Told Us to Build

### **1. Reading Hub** ❌ → ✅ **CREATED**

**Discovery:** LITERACY-RESTRUCTURE-PLAN.md showed Reading Hub was MISSING from MOE-aligned structure

**Action:**
- ✅ Created `public/reading-hub.html`
- ✅ 101 reading/comprehension resources
- ✅ 66% cultural integration (67 resources)
- ✅ 67 resources with Te Reo
- ✅ MOE Framework: 1 hour daily reading (Y7-8)
- ✅ Live GraphRAG queries for accurate counts

**Impact:** Completes MOE literacy trio (Reading + Writing + English)

---

### **2. Ghost Units** ❌ → ✅ **CONNECTED**

**Discovery:** GRAPHRAG-INTELLIGENCE-REPORT.md revealed 10+ units with ZERO lesson connections

**Problem:**
- Units existed: `public/units/unit-3-science/index.html`
- Lessons existed: `public/units/lessons/unit-3-lesson-1.html`
- GraphRAG didn't know they were connected!

**Action:**
- ✅ Built 22 `unit_contains_lesson` relationships
- ✅ Connected Units 1-5 to their lessons
- ✅ Unit 1: Te Ao Māori → 5 lessons
- ✅ Unit 2: Decolonized History → 5 lessons
- ✅ Unit 3: Science → 5 lessons
- ✅ Unit 4: Economic Justice → 5 lessons
- ✅ Unit 5: Global Connections → 2 lessons

**Impact:** Units now discoverable in knowledge graph, learning pathways traceable

---

### **3. Hub Resource Counts** ❌ → ✅ **ACCURATE**

**Discovery:** Hubs showed estimates (83+, 252+) but GraphRAG has exact counts

**Actions:**
- ✅ **Science Hub**: 83+ → **2,352 resources**
- ✅ **English Hub**: Updated to **2,211 resources**
- ✅ **Digital Tech**: Revealed **83% cultural integration** 🏆
- ✅ **Social Studies**: Revealed **98% cultural integration** 🥇
- ✅ **Mathematics**: 77+ → **372 resources**

**Impact:** Teachers see accurate resource availability, cultural integration metrics

---

### **4. Learning Progressions** ❌ → ✅ **BUILT**

**Discovery:** Only 849 prerequisite relationships for thousands of lessons = learning progression gap

**Actions Built 16 NEW Prerequisites:**

**Science Pathways (6):**
1. Y9 Ecology → Climate Change (0.93 confidence)
2. Climate → Renewable Energy (0.90)
3. Physics Nav → Māori Instruments (0.88)
4. Physics Nav → GPS Integration (0.91)
5. Scientific Method → Rongoā Chemistry (0.89)
6. Genetics → Biotech Ethics (0.92)

**Writing Pathways (3):**
1. Whakataukī → Narrative Structure (0.91)
2. Narrative → Digital Storytelling (0.89)
3. Media Literacy → Argumentative Writing (0.87)

**Math Pathways (3):**
1. Māori Games → Algebraic Thinking (0.90)
2. Geometric Patterns → Formal Geometry (0.91)
3. Modeling → Calculus (0.89)

**Cultural Pathways (4):**
1. Digital Literacy → Digital Storytelling (0.88)
2. Critical Thinking → Misinformation (0.90)
3. Te Ao Māori → AI Ethics (0.92)
4. Whakapapa → Genetics (0.94)

**Impact:** Students now have guided learning sequences, "what to learn next" is clear

**From GraphRAG data:**
- Digital Tech leads cultural integration (83%) - unexpected!
- Social Studies near perfect (98%) cultural integration
- Only 849 prerequisites for thousands of lessons - major gap
- Units had lessons but GraphRAG didn't know the relationships

   - Goal: 2,000+ (cover all major lessons)
   - Focus: Y7→Y8→Y9 progressions

2. **Fix Inflated Connection Badges**
   - Use real-time GraphRAG queries
   - Replace hardcoded counts (72, 35, 32)
   - Show actual relationship counts

3. **Enhance Existing Pages**
   - Don't create new GraphRAG explorers
   - Improve existing 14 GraphRAG tools
   - Add universal components to lesson pages

4. **Cross-Curricular Relationships**
