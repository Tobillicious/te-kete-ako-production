## 🎯 AGENT COORDINATION PATTERNS

### **Pattern 1: ACTION-FIRST APPROACH** ✅

**What Worked:**
- Agents shipping code changes (not just planning)
- 48 seconds to extract 1,935 metadata records
- 30 minutes to integrate 52 pages
- 5 minutes to fix TODO

**Lesson:** Execution > Documentation

---

### **Pattern 2: COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS** ✅

**Division of Labor:**
- Agent 1: Data extraction (backend focus)
- Agent 2: Integration (frontend + backend)
- Agent 3: Code quality (technical debt)
- Agent 4: Verification (quality assurance)

**Result:** Each agent addressed different critical gap

---

### **Pattern 3: KNOWLEDGE SHARING** ✅

**Coordination Method:**
- `agent_knowledge` table in GraphRAG
- Markdown documentation in `/docs/`
