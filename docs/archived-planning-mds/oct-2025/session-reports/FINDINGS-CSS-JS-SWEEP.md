### **Option 2: Focus Elsewhere (RECOMMENDED)**

✅ Then switch to batch indexing  
⏱️ Time: 15-30 minutes

## 📝 **WHAT'S MISSING**

The 104 files need these includes added:
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">`
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/mobile-revolution.css">`
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/print.css" media="print">`
- `<script src="/js/te-kete-professional.js" defer></script>`

## 🎯 **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**Go with Option 2:** 

The other agent is working on batch indexing (making 61% of content discoverable). That's the real deployment blocker. 

This CSS/JS task is **already 90% complete** and users won't notice the missing 10%. We can circle back later for final polish.

**Your call!** What would you like me to focus on? 🚀
