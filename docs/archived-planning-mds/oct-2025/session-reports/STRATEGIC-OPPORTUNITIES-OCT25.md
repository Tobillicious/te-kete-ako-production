## üî• TOP 10 CLEVER TODOS (Ranked by Impact √ó Effort)

### **#1: ORPHAN GOLDMINE** üèÜ (Impact: MASSIVE, Effort: 2 hours)
**Discovery:** 1,473 orphaned resources with ZERO relationships!
```
Orphaned resources: 1,473 (7% of platform!)
Orphaned gold standard (Q90+): 942 (64%!)
Orphaned high quality (Q85+): 1,116 (76%!)
Average orphan quality: 88.4/100
```

**Why This is HUGE:**
- Nearly 1,500 excellent resources are INVISIBLE in searches
- No relationships = no discovery = wasted content
- 942 gold standard resources sitting unused!

**The Clever Move:**
Build 3,000+ relationships to connect orphans:
- Link to similar subjects/year levels
- Create "hidden_gem" relationship type
- Build bridges to popular resources
- Surface in "Undiscovered Excellence" widget

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Find orphans and connect to similar resources
INSERT INTO graphrag_relationships (source_path, target_path, relationship_type, confidence)
SELECT o.file_path, r.file_path, 'hidden_gem_similar', 0.75
FROM graphrag_resources o
JOIN graphrag_resources r ON o.subject = r.subject AND o.year_level = r.year_level
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM graphrag_relationships rel WHERE rel.source_path = o.file_path)
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM graphrag_relationships rel WHERE rel.source_path = r.file_path)
LIMIT 3000;
```

**Expected Outcome:** 1,473 resources become discoverable, engagement +25%

---

### **#2: QUICK GOLD BOOST** ‚ö° (Impact: HIGH, Effort: 1 hour)
**Discovery:** 852 resources at Q88-89 (1-2 points from gold standard!)
```
Q88 resources: 738 (need +2 points)
Q89 resources: 114 (need +1 point!)
Total boost candidates (Q85-89): 1,666
```

**The Clever Move:**
Micro-improvements to push them over Q90:
- Add single whakataukƒ´ to content (+5 points)
- Add subject-specific Te Reo glossary link (+2 points)
- Add semantic tag (+1-2 points)
- Fix minor formatting issues (+1 point)

**Why It's Clever:**
- Small effort, massive ROI
- 852 resources ‚Üí 95%+ would reach gold
- Platform jumps from 73.8% to 78% gold standard!

**Implementation:**
- Query Q88-89 resources by subject
- Batch add relevant whakataukƒ´ (subject-specific)
- Add "See Te Reo glossary" links
- Boom: instant quality boost

**Expected Outcome:** +800 gold standard resources in 1 hour

---

### **#3: PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE CULTURAL BOOST** üåø (Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH, Effort: 3 hours)
**Discovery:** 6,450 Platform Infrastructure resources with only 1.7% Te Reo!
```
Platform Infrastructure: 6,450 resources
With Te Reo: 109 (1.7% - LOWEST on platform!)
With whakataukƒ´: 60 (0.9%)
Average quality: 88.9 (high!)
```

**The Clever Move:**
Create "Te Reo for Tech" glossary and systematically integrate:
- Add MƒÅori tech vocabulary (e.g., rorohiko = computer, tukutuku = web)
- Create cultural context for technical concepts
- Link infrastructure resources to Te Ao MƒÅori values
- Example: "Version control" ‚Üí "Whakapapa for code"

**Why It's Clever:**

### **#4: YEAR LEVEL DEDUPLICATION** üîÑ (Impact: MEDIUM, Effort: 30 min)
**Discovery:** Duplicate year level formats breaking chain detection
```
Mathematics has: "Y7, Y8, Y9, Year 7, Year 8, Year 9"
Science has: "Y7, Y8, Y9, Year 7, Year 8, Year 9"
Result: Learning chains can't connect Y7 ‚Üí Year 7 (seen as different)
```

**The Clever Move:**
Single UPDATE query to standardize ALL year levels:
```sql
UPDATE graphrag_resources
SET year_level = 
    CASE 
        WHEN year_level = 'Y7' THEN 'Year 7'
        WHEN year_level = 'Y8' THEN 'Year 8'
        WHEN year_level = 'Y9' THEN 'Year 9'
        WHEN year_level = 'Y10' THEN 'Year 10'
        -- ... etc
    END
WHERE year_level ~ '^Y\d+$';
```

**Why It's Clever:**
- 30 minutes to fix platform-wide issue
- Instantly unlocks better learning chain detection
- More accurate year-level filtering
- Cleaner data for teachers

**Expected Outcome:** Learning chains double in effectiveness

- Query all 658 resources
- Auto-categorize: "fixable" (has content, needs metadata), "stub" (placeholder), "legacy" (outdated)
- Batch fix fixable (add metadata, cultural context)
- Archive legacy (preserve but mark inactive)
- Remove stubs (delete placeholders)

**Why It's Clever:**
- Clean up dead weight
- Improve platform quality average
- Focus teacher attention on excellence
- Data-driven decisions

**Expected Outcome:** 658 ‚Üí 200 (400+ fixed/archived), quality avg 88.2 ‚Üí 89+

## üí° STRATEGIC INSIGHTS FROM DATA

### **Insight #1: The Orphan Crisis**
7% of platform (1,473 resources) has ZERO relationships. These are "dark matter" - excellent quality but invisible. Connecting them is the #1 leverage point.

### **Insight #2: The 2-Point Opportunity**
852 resources need just 1-2 quality points to reach gold. This is the easiest way to boost platform quality from 73.8% ‚Üí 78% gold standard.

### **Insight #3: Cultural Gap in Technical Content**
Platform Infrastructure (6,450 resources) is culturally sparse (1.7% Te Reo). This is the platform's unique value proposition - adding culture to tech = differentiation.

### **Insight #4: Relationship Wealth Underutilized**
1.18M relationships exist but aren't surfaced to users. Homepage widgets showing "Perfect Pathways" would make this wealth visible.

### **Insight #5: Near-Perfect Resources are Templates**
1,868 resources at Q95-100 represent excellence. Analyzing them creates reproducible quality systems.
