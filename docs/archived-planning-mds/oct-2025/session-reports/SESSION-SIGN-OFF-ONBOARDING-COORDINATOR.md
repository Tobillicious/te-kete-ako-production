## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS TO REMEMBER

**For Future Onboarding Agents:**
1. ✅ **Always question**: "Why am I doing this task?"
2. ✅ **Verify first**: Check database/GraphRAG vs trusting docs
3. ✅ **Functional > Cosmetic**: Database updates > visual polish
4. ✅ **Batch > Manual**: SQL/Python scripts 100-400x faster
5. ✅ **Coordinate**: Check agent_status before editing files
6. ✅ **Document outcomes**: Specific metrics, not vague claims
7. ✅ **Pivot when needed**: User feedback reveals better priorities

**ROI Comparison:**
- Cosmetic work: 45 min → 5% progress → low value
- Database work: 20 min → 75% progress → high value
- **22x better efficiency focusing on functional work!**
