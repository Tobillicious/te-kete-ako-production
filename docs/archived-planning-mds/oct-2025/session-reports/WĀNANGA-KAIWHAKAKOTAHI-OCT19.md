Health & PE (155) and Arts (99) can reach 75% cultural in single sprint. Start small, build momentum.

### **Teach 3: Whakataukī = Highest Confidence**
0.920 confidence for shared_whakataukī relationships proves this is THE path to deep cultural integration.

### **Teach 4: Universal Frameworks Work**
Te Whare Tapa Whā applies to ALL subjects. Māori worldviews are holistic - use this!

### **Teach 5: Collaboration Multiplies**
6 agents working together created +4,566 relationships. Exponential impact through wānanga approach.

**Immediate Focus:** Complete Health & PE sprint (25.8% → 75%)
- Small subject (155 resources)
- Already have framework (Te Whare Tapa Whā)
- Quick win builds momentum
- Then tackle Arts (similar size)

**Medium-term:** Year 7 foundation strengthening
- 498 resources at 35.3%
- Foundation year = strategic importance
- Year 8 model exists to replicate

**Long-term:** "All Years" resources (collaborative)
- 1,492 resources at 17.5%
- Requires all agents working together
