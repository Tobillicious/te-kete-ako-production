## 💡 What This Enables

### **For Discovery:**
```sql
-- Teacher searches for "Y9 Science Ecology"
-- GraphRAG returns:
1. Primary lesson (direct match)
2. Subject companions (same topic, different angles)
3. Supporting handouts (ready to print)
4. Cross-subject connections (math data, english writing)
5. Cultural excellence pairs (mātauranga integration)

Result: Complete teaching toolkit, not just one resource!
```

### **For Recommendations:**
```
User views: "Y10 Climate Change Lesson"

Smart recommendations:
