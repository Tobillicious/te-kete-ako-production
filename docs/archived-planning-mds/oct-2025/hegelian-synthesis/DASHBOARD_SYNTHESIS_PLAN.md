## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS:**

### **Phase 1: Rename Canonical Teacher Dashboard**
```bash
mv public/teacher-dashboard-unified.html public/teacher-dashboard-NEW.html
mv public/teacher-dashboard.html public/archive-dashboards/teacher-dashboard-OLD.html
mv public/teacher-dashboard-NEW.html public/teacher-dashboard.html
```

### **Phase 2: Update All Links**
Find all references to old dashboards, update to point to canonical versions:
- `teacher-dashboard-unified.html` → `teacher-dashboard.html`
- `student-dashboard.html` → Keep as-is
- `enterprise-admin-dashboard.html` → Keep as-is

### **Phase 3: Archive Non-Canonical Dashboards**
Create `/public/archive-dashboards/` directory
Move 39 duplicate dashboards there with date stamp

### **Phase 4: Document Canonical Architecture**
```
CANONICAL DASHBOARDS:
├── student-dashboard.html (Students)
├── teacher-dashboard.html (Teachers)  
└── enterprise-admin-dashboard.html (School Admins)

SPECIALIZED VIEWS (accessed from main dashboards):
├── Subject-specific views (linked from teacher dashboard)
├── GraphRAG analytics (enterprise admin)
└── KAMAR integration (enterprise admin)
```

## 💡 **RATIONALE:**

**Why teacher-dashboard-unified.html is canonical:**
- Recent synthesis (Oct 2025)
- Combines best features from all variants
- Already battle-tested
- Unified architecture

**Why keep 3 separate dashboards:**
- Different user roles (student vs teacher vs admin)
- Different permissions/features
- Different workflows
- Hegelian synthesis = best of each role, not one-size-fits-all

**STATUS:** Ready for execution upon user approval! 🚀
