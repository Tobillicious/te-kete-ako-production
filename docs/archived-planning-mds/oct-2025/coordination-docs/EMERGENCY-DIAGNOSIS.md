# 🚨 EMERGENCY: Site Completely Broken

**Status:** CRITICAL - Site unusable  
**Symptom:** Something covering entire screen, blocking ALL content  
**User Impact:** 100% broken, cannot use site

---

## 🔴 **WHAT I CHANGED (Suspect List)**

1. ✅ Disabled graphrag-connection-counter.js on 20+ pages
2. ✅ Added CSS classes (.hero-perfect, .pathway-perfect, .confidence-perfect)
3. ❌ **TRIED to hide navigation items** (may have broken nav structure)
4. ✅ Hidden sections with `display: none`
5. ❌ **Git commits pushed** (changes are LIVE!)

## 🎯 **MOST LIKELY CULPRIT**

**Navigation component broken!**
- `navigation-standard.html` loads on every page
- I may have broken its HTML structure
- Navigation might be rendering as full-screen overlay
- Missing closing tags could break entire page layout

---

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED**

Check `public/components/navigation-standard.html` for:
- Unclosed `<div>` tags
- Broken HTML structure
- CSS causing overlay behavior

**Investigating now...**
