# 🖨️ TEACHER PRINTING GUIDE - Wordsearches

**Quick Start**: Print beautiful, professional wordsearches for your classroom

---

## 📄 **PRINT LAYOUT: 2 Per A4 Page**

Each A4 page prints **TWO wordsearches** (each one is A5 size):

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Wordsearch Puzzle #1  │  ← Top half (A5)
│   [Grid + Word List]    │
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Wordsearch Puzzle #2  │  ← Bottom half (A5)
│   [Grid + Word List]    │
└─────────────────────────┘
     A4 Page (210mm × 297mm)
```

**Cut in half** → Give each student one A5 wordsearch  
**OR leave whole** → Student does both for extra practice

## 🌿 **CULTURAL TEACHING MOMENTS**

Each wordsearch includes whakataukī - use these to:

1. **Discuss Meaning**: What does the proverb mean?
2. **Connect to Lesson**: How does it relate to today's learning?
3. **Cultural Context**: Why is this wisdom important?
4. **Student Reflection**: Create your own whakataukī for this topic

**Example**:
"He tukutuku whakairo, he mea hanga nā te hinengaro"  
→ Discuss how patterns in Māori art show mathematical thinking  
→ Connect to algebraic patterns in the lesson  
→ Honor mātauranga Māori as sophisticated mathematics
