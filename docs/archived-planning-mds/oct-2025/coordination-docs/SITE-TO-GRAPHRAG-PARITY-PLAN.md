## 🎯 **THE STRATEGY: 5 PHASES TO PARITY**

---

## **PHASE 1: EXPOSE THE RELATIONSHIPS (Week 1)**

### **Goal**: Make GraphRAG's 240K relationships VISIBLE and USEFUL

#### **1.1 Interactive Knowledge Graph Page**
```
/knowledge-graph-explorer.html
- D3.js force-directed graph
- Click any resource → see all connections
- Filter by relationship type (prerequisite, cross_subject, cultural, etc.)
- Color-code by subject
- Size nodes by connection count
- Show relationship strength (confidence scores)
```

#### **1.2 Learning Pathway Visualizer**
```
/learning-pathways.html
- Show prerequisite chains as flowcharts
- "Start here" → "Then this" → "Finally this"
- Visualize Y7-Y13 progressions
- Click any lesson → see prerequisites & what comes next
- Export pathway as PDF for teachers
```

#### **1.3 Cross-Subject Discovery Engine**
```
/cross-subject-connections.html (enhance existing page)
- Show all 345 relationship types
- "Teaching Math? Here are 30 Science connections!"
- Visual map showing interdisciplinary links
- Filter by subject pair (Math×Science, English×Social Studies, etc.)
- Click connection → see both resources side-by-side
```

**Deliverables**: 3 pages that SHOW the 240K relationships
**Impact**: Teachers see WHY resources connect, students understand progressions

---

## **PHASE 2: SHOWCASE THE CULTURAL EXCELLENCE (Week 2)**

```

**Deliverables**: 3 pages making quality transparent
**Impact**: Teachers confidently choose BEST resources, understand WHY

## **PHASE 4: RELATIONSHIP-DRIVEN DISCOVERY (Week 4)**

### **Goal**: Use 345 relationship types for intelligent recommendations

#### **4.1 Smart Resource Recommender**
```
/smart-recommender.html

- "Cultural connection:" (shares_whakataukī)
- "Similar resources:" (similar_to)
```

#### **4.2 Gap Finder Dashboard**
```
/gap-finder.html
- "Your unit has no prerequisites listed"
- "These resources are under-connected" (< 5 connections)
- "Missing cross-subject opportunities"
- "No Q90+ resources in this topic"
- Actionable suggestions to fill gaps
```

#### **4.3 Influence Hubs Visualizer**
```
/influence-hubs.html
- Show most-connected resources (influence = connection count)
- "These 10 resources are CENTRAL to curriculum"
- Visualize which resources unlock others
- See knowledge bottlenecks
- Identify foundational vs advanced concepts
```

**Deliverables**: 3 pages using relationships for recommendations
**Impact**: Personalized discovery, every teacher sees relevant next steps

## **PHASE 5: COMPLETE THE UNITS (Ongoing)**

### **Goal**: All units in GraphRAG become browseable on site

#### **5.1 House Leader Units (4 remaining)**
```
Currently: Walker ✅, Hērangi ✅ (2/6)

## 💡 **THE BIG IDEA:**

**GraphRAG IS THE BRAIN. We need to build the NERVOUS SYSTEM - the pathways that let users FEEL the intelligence!**

Right now:
- ❌ Relationships are invisible (but exist!)
- ❌ Quality scores are numbers (but could be stories!)
- ❌ Cultural depth is hidden (but profoundly rich!)
- ❌ Prerequisites exist (but not visualized!)

After Parity:
- ✅ Click any resource → see its entire network
- ✅ Visual maps show learning journeys
- ✅ Cultural connections are obvious
- ✅ Quality differences are explained
- ✅ Smart recommendations guide every click

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS:**

| Metric | Current | After Parity |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Resources Browseable | 5,484 | 1,640+ (all in GraphRAG) |
| Relationships Visible | 52 (new ones) | 240,328 (all!) |
| Cultural Showcase | 40 (under-connected) | 627 (full network) |
| Quality Explanations | Badges only | Q100/Q95/Q90 tiers + WHY |
| Learning Pathways | Minimal | Full prerequisite trees |
| Cross-Subject Discovery | 30 links shown | 345 types visualized |
| House Leader Units | 2/6 | 6/6 |

---

## 🌟 **THE VISION:**

**Te Kete Ako becomes the ONLY platform where:**
1. **GraphRAG intelligence is VISIBLE** (not hidden in database)
2. **Relationships DRIVE discovery** (not manual search)
3. **Quality is TRANSPARENT** (not arbitrary)
4. **Cultural depth is CELEBRATED** (not tokenized)
5. **Learning pathways are CLEAR** (not guesswork)

## ❓ **WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD NEXT?**

**Choose your adventure:**

**A.** 🔗 **"Show me the relationships!"** → Build knowledge graph explorer (D3.js visualization)

**B.** 🌿 **"Celebrate the culture!"** → Build cultural excellence network (627 resources)

**C.** ⭐ **"Explain the quality!"** → Build Q100/Q95/Q90 tier showcases

**D.** 🏛️ **"Complete the units!"** → Convert Ngata Unit (5 lessons) to HTML
