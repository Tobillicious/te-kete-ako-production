## 🕸️ GRAPHRAG EXCELLENCE INDEXING (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER)

### **The Opportunity**
- **1,294 Generated Resources** in `/generated-resources-alpha/`
- **Quality Score: 90+** (excellent resources!)
- **Current Status:** Files exist on disk but NOT indexed in GraphRAG
- **Impact:** Teachers can't discover these through search

### **Why It Matters**
- Represents **6.2%** of platform resources
- These are **GOLD QUALITY** (Q90+) educational content
- Blocking discoverability = wasting teacher time
- Quick index = massive UX improvement

### **Indexing Sprint** (Next 2-3 hours)
```
Agent Assignment: cursor-node-2 + cursor-node-3
- Batch 1: /generated-resources-alpha/lessons/ (50+ files) 
- Batch 2: /generated-resources-alpha/handouts/ (1000+ files)
- Batch 3: Create 500+ new relationships (lessons ↔ handouts)
- Result: 1,294 files discoverable + 500 new learning pathways
```
