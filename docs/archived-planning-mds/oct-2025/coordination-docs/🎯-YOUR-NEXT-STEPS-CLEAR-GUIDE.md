# Push to GitHub (triggers Netlify auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

**Expected:**
- GitHub push: ~10 seconds
- Netlify deployment: ~2-3 minutes
- Platform live at: https://tekete.netlify.app

**Verify deployment:**
- Check Netlify dashboard
- Visit https://tekete.netlify.app

## 🎯 **STEP 2: RUN SIMULATION (30 seconds)**

**After platform is deployed:**

```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean

# Run 1000 teacher simulations on LIVE site
python3 simulate-live-platform.py
```

**What it does:**
- Simulates 1000 real teacher journeys
- Tests 5 different teacher personas (200 each)
- Identifies friction points
- Ranks issues by frequency
- Provides fix recommendations
- Saves results to: `simulation-live-platform-results.json`

**Expected output:**
```

## 🔧 **STEP 3: FIX TOP 5 ISSUES (1-2 hours)**

**Based on simulation results, fix in priority order:**

### **Example Fix 1: Emergency Lesson Links**
```bash
# If simulation shows broken links, verify GraphRAG queries
# Check emergency-lessons.html
# Update links to correct resources
```

### **Example Fix 2: Search Filters**
```bash
# Debug public/js/enhanced-search-v2.js
# Test filter logic
# Fix any JavaScript errors
```

### **Example Fix 3: Preview Modal CSS**
```bash
# Check public/css/components/preview-modal.css
# Resolve conflicts with other CSS
# Test on multiple browsers
```

### **Example Fix 4: Cultural Hub Visibility**
```bash
# Add link to main navigation
# Enhance homepage card
# Add breadcrumbs
```

### **Example Fix 5: Download Manager**
```bash
# Verify public/js/download-manager.js loaded on all pages
# Check script includes in hub pages
# Test functionality
```

**After fixes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔧 FIX: Iteration 1 - Top 5 simulation issues

Fixes:
- Emergency lesson links verified and updated
- Search filters debugged and working
- Preview modal CSS conflicts resolved
- Cultural hub added to main navigation
- Download manager loaded consistently

Success rate improvement: 93.8% → 97%+ (target)"

git push origin main
# Wait for Netlify deployment (~2 min)
```

---

## 🔄 **STEP 4: RE-SIMULATE (30 seconds)**

```bash
# After fixes deployed
python3 simulate-live-platform.py

# Compare results
# Expected improvement: 93.8% → 97%+
```

**Decision:**
- If 99%+: ✅ **SHIP TO BETA TEACHERS!**
- If 95-99%: 🔄 Do Iteration 2 (fix next 3-5 issues)
- If <95%: 🔧 Debug major issues
