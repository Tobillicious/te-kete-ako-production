# 🔗 BROKEN LINK FIXING - PROGRESS TRACKER

**Started:** October 26, 2025 morning  
**Goal:** Fix ALL 3,200+ broken links  
**Method:** GraphRAG intelligence (query database for correct paths)  
**Status:** 🟢 IN PROGRESS

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED BATCHES:**

### **BATCH 1: top-10-starter-pack.html** ✅ (9 links fixed)
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Method:** Queried GraphRAG for actual lesson paths, replaced all placeholder links

**Fixed:**
1. Y8 Science → Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga (lesson-1-what-is-our-digital-whenua.html)
2. Y7 Algebra → Y7 Maths Algebra (lesson-1-patterns-and-sequences.html)
3. Te Reo Greetings → Te Reo Basics (lesson-6-te-reo-basics.html)
4. Digital Kaitiakitanga → Genetics & Whakapapa (genetics-and-whakapapa...)
5. Treaty → Whakapapa & Identity (lesson-2-whakapapa-identity.html)
6. Storytelling → Creative Writing Whakataukī (creative-writing-inspired...)
7. Climate → Ecosystems & Kaitiakitanga (lesson-1-kaitiakitanga-intro.html)
8. Y9 Statistics → Y9 Statistics Chain (lesson-1-introduction-statistical...)
9. Hauora → Te Whare Tapa Whā (health-and-wellbeing-te-whare...)

### **BATCH 2: emergency-lessons.html** ✅ (1 link fixed)
**Time:** 5 minutes

**Fixed:**
1. AI Ethics FIXED version → Real AI Ethics lesson (ai-ethics-through-māori-data-sovereignty.html)

## 📊 **OVERALL PROGRESS:**

**Links Fixed:** 10 / ~3,200 (0.3%)  
**Time Invested:** 20 minutes  
**Files Cleaned:** 2  
**Deployed:** ✅ LIVE on production!

**Remaining:** ~3,190 broken links across ~2,000 files

## 🎯 **NEXT TARGETS:**

### **High-Priority Pages** (Fix first!):
- [ ] Homepage (public/index.html)
- [ ] Subject hubs (mathematics-hub, science-hub, etc.)
- [ ] Collections page
- [ ] Teacher onboarding
- [ ] Beta invitation

### **Medium-Priority:**
- [ ] Unit index pages
- [ ] Lesson navigation (prev/next links)
- [ ] Walker unit lessons
- [ ] Critical Thinking lessons
- [ ] Writers Toolkit lessons

### **Lower-Priority:**
- [ ] Backup files (.bak, .master-backup)
- [ ] Archive directories
- [ ] Component templates
- [ ] Legacy pages

## ⏱️ **ESTIMATED TIME REMAINING:**

**At current pace (10 links/20 min):**
- 3,190 links ÷ 10 = 319 batches
- 319 × 20 min = 6,380 minutes = **106 hours!** 😱

**Optimized approach (batching + automation):**
- High-priority pages: 100 links × 2 min = 3-4 hours
- Medium-priority: 500 links × 1 min = 8-10 hours  
- Automated script for remaining: 2-3 hours development + 1 hour runtime

**REALISTIC TOTAL: 14-18 hours with smart batching!**

---

## 💡 **STRATEGY UPDATE:**

**Current approach:** Manual one-by-one replacement  
**Better approach:** Create automated link-fixing script!

**Script would:**
1. Load GraphRAG path lookup table
2. Scan all HTML files for broken link patterns
3. Match broken links to GraphRAG paths using fuzzy matching
4. Auto-replace with correct paths
5. Generate report of what was fixed

**Time to build script:** 2-3 hours  
**Time saved:** 10-15 hours!  
**Net benefit:** 8-12 hours saved!

## 🤔 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Switch to automation!**

Instead of manually fixing 3,200 links (14-18 hours), build an intelligent auto-fixer (2-3 hours) that does it all!

**Benefits:**
- Faster (3h vs 18h)
- More accurate (database-driven)
- Repeatable (can re-run if new broken links)
- Documented (generates fix report)

**What do you think?**

**A.** Continue manual fixing (14-18 hours total)  
**B.** Build automated fixer script (2-3 hours, then 1 hour runtime)  
**C.** Fix only high-priority pages manually (3-4 hours), skip the rest  

---

**Current Status:** 10 links fixed ✅, deployed ✅, 3,190 remaining  
**My Recommendation:** **Option B** (Build automated fixer!)
