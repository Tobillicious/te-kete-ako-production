# 🚀 SHIP → SIMULATE → FIX STRATEGY

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Strategy:** Ship fast, simulate real usage, fix iteratively  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  

---

## 🎯 **THE STRATEGY**

**Universal Law #4: Ship > Plan**
> "Real usage reveals more than any simulation"  
> "Shipping unlocks learning that planning cannot"  
> "97/100 is EXCELLENT for shipping!"  

### **3-Phase Approach:**

1. **SHIP NOW** (5 min)
   - Deploy to Netlify production
   - Platform is A+ (97/100)
   - All critical features working

2. **SIMULATE LIVE** (30 min)
   - Run 1000 teacher simulations on LIVE site
   - Test actual pages, actual links, actual performance
   - Identify real friction points

3. **FIX ITERATIVELY** (ongoing)
   - Fix top 5 issues from simulation
   - Re-simulate
   - Fix next 5 issues
   - Continuous improvement loop

## 📋 **PHASE 1: SHIP NOW**

**Current Status:** A+ (97/100) ✅

**Ready to Ship:**
- ✅ All 5 P0 critical tasks complete
- ✅ All 7 P1 high priority tasks complete
- ✅ Emergency lessons accessible
- ✅ Quality badges deployed
- ✅ Cultural hub live
- ✅ Search enhanced
- ✅ Print optimized
- ✅ Downloads working
- ✅ Preview modals functional
- ✅ Mobile excellent

**Deployment:**
```bash
# Already configured with Netlify
# Automatic deployment on git push
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 SHIP: Platform A+ (97/100) - All P0+P1 complete"
git push origin main

# Netlify auto-deploys to: https://tekete.netlify.app
```

**Expected:** Live in ~2 minutes ✅

---

## 📋 **PHASE 2: SIMULATE LIVE (Post-Ship)**

**Simulation Framework:**
- Use actual production URL: https://tekete.netlify.app
- Test real page load times
- Test actual link functionality
- Test real search performance
- Test real download speeds
- Test mobile responsiveness on live site

**Teacher Personas (1000 sessions):**
1. Sarah - Substitute Teacher (200 sessions)
   - Entry: Homepage → Emergency Lessons
   - Goal: Find lesson in <5 min
   - Success: PDF downloaded & ready

2. Aroha - Māori Medium Kaiako (200 sessions)
   - Entry: Homepage → Cultural Hub
   - Goal: Find culturally integrated content
   - Success: Quality visible, content accessed

3. James - First-Time Teacher (200 sessions)
   - Entry: Homepage → Subject Hub
   - Goal: Preview and download lesson
   - Success: Smooth first experience

4. Maria - Experienced Teacher (200 sessions)
   - Entry: Search or Subject Hub
   - Goal: Find specific unit
   - Success: Found in <10 min

5. David - Tech Teacher (200 sessions)
   - Entry: Advanced features
   - Goal: Test all functionality
   - Success: Everything works

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Time to success
- Pages visited
- Friction points encountered
- Features used
- Success/failure rate
- Real page load times
- Actual link clicks
- Download completion rates

## 📋 **PHASE 3: FIX ITERATIVELY**

**Iteration Cycle:**
```
1. Run simulation (1000 sessions)
2. Analyze results
3. Identify top 5 friction points
4. Fix them (priority order)
5. Deploy fixes
6. Re-simulate
7. Repeat
```

**Fix Priority Matrix:**
```
Impact × Frequency = Priority Score

High Impact + High Frequency = FIX NOW (P0)
High Impact + Low Frequency = FIX SOON (P1)
Low Impact + High Frequency = FIX LATER (P2)
Low Impact + Low Frequency = BACKLOG (P3)
```

**Expected Iterations:**
- Iteration 1: Top 5 issues (1-2 hours)
- Iteration 2: Next 5 issues (1-2 hours)
- Iteration 3: Polish (1 hour)
- Result: Platform 97% → 99%+ excellence!

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**After Ship + Simulation + Fixes:**
- Success rate: 97%+ (all personas)
- Time to success: Under target for each persona
- Zero critical friction points
- All features working on live site
- Ready for beta teachers

**Then:** Send beta invitations! 🎊

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

**Phase 1 - SHIP NOW:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS  
**Phase 2 - SIMULATE LIVE:** ⏸️ Pending ship  
**Phase 3 - FIX ITERATIVELY:** ⏸️ Pending simulation  

**Next Step:** Deploy to production NOW!
