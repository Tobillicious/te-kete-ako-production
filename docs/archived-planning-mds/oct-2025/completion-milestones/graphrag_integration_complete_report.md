## üéØ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Integration Process**
1. **File Discovery**: Systematic scan of all 1,411 MD files
2. **Content Analysis**: Title extraction, key insights, metadata
3. **Categorization**: Source type and document type determination
4. **Agent Mapping**: Identification of involved agents
5. **Quality Scoring**: 70-95 score algorithm with cultural bonuses
6. **SQL Generation**: Batch insertion statements for database
7. **Database Integration**: Addition to agent_knowledge table
8. **Relationship Building**: Automatic prerequisite and concept linking

### **Enhanced agent_knowledge Table Structure**
```sql
- source_type: session_complete, platform_audit, task_list, strategic_plan, etc.
- source_name: Document title and purpose
- doc_type: session_summary, audit_report, strategic_plan, achievement, etc.
- key_insights: ARRAY of main points and findings
- technical_details: JSONB with metadata (file_path, quality_score, word_count, etc.)
- agents_involved: ARRAY of agents mentioned in document
- cultural_content: Boolean indicating cultural relevance
- has_dates: Boolean for temporal context
- has_metrics: Boolean for quantitative data
```
