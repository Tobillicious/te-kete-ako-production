## 💡 **WHAT'S STILL NEEDED (For Production):**

### **API Keys (User Input Required):**
1. OAuth providers (Google + Azure AD) - code ready
2. PostHog production key - analytics deployed
3. Stripe production keys - checkout ready

### **Testing (Requires Real Devices/Users):**
1. Mobile testing protocol - test on real phones
2. Lighthouse audit - terminal command blocked
3. Beta teacher recruitment - send emails

### **Python Scripts (Automation):**
1. Deploy teaching variants from archive (505 resources)
2. Generate semantic embeddings (17,457 resources)

---

## 🎓 **KEY INSIGHTS:**

### **What Works:**
- **GraphRAG-First Workflow:** Query before building = efficient
- **MCP Supabase:** Bypasses terminal command hang issues
- **Hegelian Synthesis:** System components→1, Teaching resources→2-3 variants
- **User-Centered:** Think like teacher, not developer

### **What's Different:**
- Not "deploying 15,000 missing resources"
- **IS** enriching & connecting existing resources
- Not eliminating duplicates blindly
- **IS** curating pedagogical variants thoughtfully

### **Philosophy Proven:**
- **Real teacher needs > Perfect code**
- **Visible quality > Backend perfection**
- **Ship and iterate > Perfect then launch**
