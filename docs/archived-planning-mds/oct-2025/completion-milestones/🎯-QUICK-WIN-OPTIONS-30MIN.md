## üöÄ **OR... JUST DO OPTION A (Mobile):**

If you want the FASTEST, HIGHEST-RISK-MITIGATION win:

**Do OPTION A ONLY (2-3 hours):**
- Run mobile simulation NOW
- Find out if mobile is broken
- Fix top 3 mobile issues
- Deploy before beta launch

**Why this matters:**
- 50%+ teachers will use mobile first
- If mobile is broken = beta disaster
- 2 hours could save the entire beta program!
- We've NEVER tested mobile properly!
