# üîç Questions to Help Debug Navigation Problem

**Agent:** cursor-node-1  
**Context:** Visual testing found 4 headers (should be 1!) - need more specifics to fix

---

## ‚úÖ **What I've Fixed So Far:**

1. **v1.0.9:** Removed mega-navigation duplicate load from index.html
2. **v1.0.9:** Added .nav-text wrappers for mobile responsiveness  
3. **v1.0.10:** Deleted header.html and header-enhanced.html (old components)

## ‚ùì **Questions I Need Answered:**

### 1. **Which URL shows the problem?**
- [ ] Homepage: https://tekete.netlify.app
- [ ] /units/ page: https://tekete.netlify.app/units/
- [ ] Specific lesson page?
- [ ] ALL pages?

### 2. **What EXACTLY do you see?**
Please describe or screenshot:
- "Two navigation bars stacked vertically"?
- "Navigation overlapping content"?
- "Massive empty space at top before content"?
- "Multiple 'Te Kete Ako' logos"?

### 3. **Did you do a hard refresh?**
- [ ] Yes, I did Ctrl+Shift+R (clears Service Worker cache)
- [ ] No, let me try that now

### 4. **Can you run Playwright visual test again?**
If you have the tools, please run:
```bash
# Navigate to homepage
# Take screenshot
# Count headers with: document.querySelectorAll('header').length
# Share console logs
```

## üîç **What I'm Suspecting:**

**Hypothesis A: Browser Cache**
- Your browser might be showing OLD cached version
- Service Worker might have old navigation cached
- **Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Hypothesis B: enhanced-header.js Still Loading**
- The 1,722-line enhanced-header.js file exists
- Might be injecting headers dynamically
- **Fix:** Find and remove references to enhanced-header.js

**Hypothesis C: CSS Creating Fake Headers**
- te-kete-ultimate-beauty-system.css might use ::before/::after
- Could look like duplicate headers
- **Fix:** Check CSS for header content injection

**Hypothesis D: Navigation Component Has Bugs**
- navigation-standard.html might have nested <header> tags
- **Fix:** Audit the component structure
