# üîç RLS Mystery - Why 401 Despite Correct Setup?

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Issue:** Frontend gets 401, backend queries work fine

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S CORRECT:**

1. **API Key:** Matches current anon key ‚úÖ
2. **RLS Policy:** Correctly set to `{anon,authenticated}` ‚úÖ  
3. **Backend Queries:** Work perfectly (242K rows returned) ‚úÖ
4. **Policy Condition:** `true` (allows all) ‚úÖ

---

## ü§î **WHY FRONTEND GETS 401:**

### **Hypothesis 1: Cache Issue**
- Browser cached old 401 response
- Service worker cached failed requests
- Need hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **Hypothesis 2: Netlify Build Timing**
- Code has old API key in build
- New key not yet deployed
- Waiting for Netlify rebuild

### **Hypothesis 3: ENV Variables**
- `window.SUPABASE_URL` not set correctly
- `window.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` not set correctly  
- Falling back to hardcoded values

### **Hypothesis 4: Service Worker**
- PWA service worker caching old responses
- Need to unregister and re-register

---

## üéØ **MOST LIKELY:**

**It's a deployment/cache issue!**

The code changes are in Git but:
1. Netlify is still building
2. Browser has cached the old version
3. Service Worker needs to update

**Solution:** Wait for Netlify build + hard refresh!

---

**Next Steps:** Check if Netlify build is complete, then hard refresh browser.
