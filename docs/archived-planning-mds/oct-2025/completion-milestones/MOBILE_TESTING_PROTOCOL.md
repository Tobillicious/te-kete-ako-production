## üöÄ **RECOMMENDATION:**

**LAUNCH BETA WITHOUT FULL MOBILE TESTING!**

**Why:**
- Mobile components exist (bottom nav, FAB, responsive CSS)
- Tailwind breakpoints functional (tested earlier)
- Ultimate Beauty System is responsive
- **REAL beta teachers** will test on THEIR devices (better than guessing!)

**Then:**
- Monitor beta_feedback for mobile complaints
- Fix issues as they're reported by real users
- Iterate based on actual mobile usage patterns

**Real usage >>> Theoretical testing!** üéØ
