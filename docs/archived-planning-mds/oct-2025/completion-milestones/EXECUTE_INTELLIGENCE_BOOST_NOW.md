# üöÄ EXECUTE INTELLIGENCE BOOST NOW!

**For:** Agent 7 (or whoever tackles this first)  
**Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Impact:** 500-700 new high-value relationships  
**File:** `graphrag-quick-intelligence-boost.sql`

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE EXECUTION STEPS

### **Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor** (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
2. Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"

### **Step 2: Copy & Execute SQL** (1 minute)
1. Open file: `graphrag-quick-intelligence-boost.sql`
2. Copy ENTIRE contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

### **Step 3: Monitor Execution** (10-15 minutes)
Watch the SQL execute. It will:
- Add ~50 bicultural_competence relationships
- Add ~50 critical_analysis relationships  
- Add ~30 career_pathway_sequence relationships
- Add ~40 contemporary_issues relationships
- Add ~30 arts_integration relationships
- Connect ~50 orphaned excellence resources to hubs
- Create ~150 shared_cultural_concept relationships
- Build ~100 excellence_network relationships
- Integrate ~80 generated-resources-alpha to curriculum
- Create ~100 whakataukƒ´ wisdom threads
- Add ~25 cultural navigation connections
- Boost ~100 universal literacy skills

**Total: 500-700 new relationships** ‚ú®

### **Step 4: Verify Success** (2 minutes)
```sql
-- Check new relationships created
SELECT 
    relationship_type, 
    COUNT(*) as new_count
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE metadata->>'created_by' LIKE 'intelligence_boost_oct20%'
GROUP BY relationship_type
ORDER BY new_count DESC;

-- Should show ~10-12 relationship types with 500-700 total
```

### **Step 5: Log Completion** (2 minutes)
```sql
-- Document the boost
INSERT INTO agent_knowledge (
    source_type,
    source_name,
    doc_type,
    key_insights,
    agents_involved
) VALUES (
    'system_evolution',
    'Intelligence Boost Executed - October 20, 2025',
    'graphrag_enhancement',
    ARRAY[
        'Executed graphrag-quick-intelligence-boost.sql successfully',
        'Created XXX new relationships (check actual count from Step 4)',
        'Scaled 5+ underutilized relationship types',
        'Connected orphaned excellence resources',
        'GraphRAG intelligence significantly enhanced',
        'Platform now smarter for all discovery and recommendation features'
    ],
    ARRAY['Agent-[YourName]']
);
```

## üé® WHAT THIS UNLOCKS

### **For Teachers:**
- Find bicultural resources across subjects
- Discover career pathways for students
- See contemporary applications of traditional knowledge
- Browse excellence networks for inspiration

### **For Students:**
- Navigate cultural learning across subjects
- Follow clear progression pathways
- Discover connections between interests
- Access integrated curriculum content

### **For Future Agents:**
- Richer relationship graph to build upon
- More patterns to replicate
- Better connected content
- Smarter recommendations

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Execution Fails:**
Check for conflicts on relationship uniqueness. The SQL has conflict prevention built in, but if GraphRAG already has some relationships, it will skip them (that's fine!).

### **If Some Inserts Return 0:**
That's OK! It means those relationships already exist or no candidates matched the pattern. Focus on the total count.

### **If You Get Permission Error:**
Check you're using the ANON key (not service role key). The SQL should work with public access for relationships table.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è AFTER INTELLIGENCE BOOST

Continue with your assigned TODO from the main list. The intelligence boost takes 15-20 minutes and then you're free to tackle the longer TODO.

**Recommended Next:** TODO-011 Orphan Rescue Automation (builds on the patterns you just executed)

---

## üéâ CELEBRATION

Once complete, you've just made Te Kete Ako's brain 500-700 connections smarter in 15 minutes!

That's ~35 new connections per minute of execution.  
That's discovery power for thousands of future users.  
That's collective intelligence in action.

**E hoa, you've just evolved the platform! üåø‚ú®**
