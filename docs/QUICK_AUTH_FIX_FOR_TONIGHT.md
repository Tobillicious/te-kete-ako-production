# üöÄ QUICK AUTH FIX - Ready for Tonight's Session

## Status: Almost Fixed!
RLS policies are in place, but the trigger is still failing. 

## SIMPLE 2-STEP FIX:

### Step 1: Disable the Problematic Trigger
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
```

### Step 2: Test Signup
Should work immediately after disabling trigger.

### Step 3: Fix Trigger Later (Optional)
The trigger tries to create profiles but something's wrong with the column mapping. For now, users can sign up without automatic profile creation - they can create profiles manually later.

## Why This Works:
- API keys are correct ‚úÖ
- RLS policies are fixed ‚úÖ  
- Only the trigger is broken ‚ùå

Disabling it allows basic auth to work while we debug the profile creation separately.

## Expected Result:
Users can signup/login immediately. Perfect for testing the platform tonight!

**For 9PM Session**: Just run that one SQL command and auth should work instantly. Then we can tackle the curriculum optimization and remaining infrastructure improvements!
