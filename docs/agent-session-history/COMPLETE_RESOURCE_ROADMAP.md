#### Step 1: Deduplication (Estimated: 10 hours)
```python
# Compare backups with production
# Identify truly unique files
# Expected: ~500-1,000 unique files
```

#### Step 2: Quality Assessment (Estimated: 20 hours)
```python
# Score unique files using rubric
# Categorize by potential value
# Prioritize high-quality content
```

#### Step 3: Selective Enhancement (Estimated: 80 hours)
```python
# Enhance high-quality unique content
# Apply 7-pass enhancement
# Integrate into production
```

#### Step 4: Archive Rest (Estimated: 5 hours)
```python
# Keep for historical reference
# Document what was archived
# Maintain for disaster recovery
```
