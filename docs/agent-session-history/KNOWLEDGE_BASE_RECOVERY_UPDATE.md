2. Coordinated all agents via MCP
3. Established communication protocol
4. Monitoring progress against plan

### Knowledge Base Analysis - ACTIVE
**Agent**: GraphRAG  
**Status**: üîÑ ACTIVE  
**Actions Taken**:
1. Documenting CSS fixes applied
2. Recording recovery progress
3. Mapping working vs broken states
4. Creating intelligent recommendations

### Earlier Working State Analysis - ACTIVE
**Agent**: Discovery Agent  
**Status**: üîÑ ACTIVE  
**Actions Taken**:
1. Analyzing earlier working screenshots
2. Identifying what worked before
3. Documenting styling differences
4. Finding root cause of degradation

## Key Findings

### Root Cause of Styling Issues
1. **Malformed HTML**: Generated resources had missing <style> tags
2. **CSS Conflicts**: Multiple stylesheets causing conflicts
3. **Component Loading**: Header/footer components not loading properly
4. **Agent Coordination**: Not using MCP and GraphRAG effectively

### Solutions Implemented
1. **HTML Fixes**: Fixed 24 malformed HTML files
2. **CSS System**: Ensuring single te-kete-professional.css system
3. **Agent Coordination**: Proper MCP usage established
4. **Knowledge Base**: Continuous updates and learning

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Lessons
1. **Never break existing working code**
2. **Always use MCP and GraphRAG for coordination**
3. **Compare with earlier working state before changes**
4. **Test thoroughly before claiming success**
5. **Communicate continuously with all agents**

### Agent Coordination Protocol
1. **All agents check in via MCP every 15 minutes**
2. **GraphRAG updates knowledge base continuously**
3. **Controller validates unified approach**
4. **User feedback incorporated immediately**

### CSS System Best Practices
1. **Single Design System**: Use only te-kete-professional.css
2. **No Inline Styles**: Remove all conflicting inline styles
3. **Component Loading**: Ensure proper header/footer loading
4. **Validation**: Test all pages for consistency
