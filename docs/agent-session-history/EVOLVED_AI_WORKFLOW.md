# üß† EVOLVED AI WORKFLOW - Te Kete Ako

**Purpose:** Pure AI workflow optimized for building world-class educational platform  
**Replaces:** Multiple agents, coordination theatre, endless MDs

---

## THE PROBLEM WITH OUR OLD APPROACH

‚ùå 12 agents creating duplicate docs  
‚ùå Coordination theatre instead of building  
‚ùå Lost sight of goal (build platform, not coordinate)  
‚ùå Too much process, too little progress  

---

## THE NEW APPROACH: INTELLIGENT SINGLE-AGENT WITH GRAPHRAG

### Core Principle
**ONE lead agent with Supabase GraphRAG as brain + ability to spawn task-specific agents**

### How It Works

#### 1. QUERY GRAPHRAG FIRST (Always)
```python
from supabase import create_client
supabase = create_client(URL, KEY)

# Before ANY decision
resources = supabase.table('resources').select('*').ilike('title', '%topic%').execute()
# Make decision based on what actually exists
```

#### 2. DECIDE & ACT (Not endless planning)
- Query GraphRAG
- Make decision in < 2 minutes
- Execute immediately
- No coordination docs

#### 3. LOG OUTCOME TO GRAPHRAG (Learning)
- What worked/didn't
- For future queries
- Builds institutional knowledge

#### 4. SPAWN SPECIALIZED AGENTS ONLY WHEN NEEDED
- Complex CSS refactoring? Spawn CSS agent
- Cultural content validation? Spawn cultural agent
- Otherwise: Just do it yourself

## WORKFLOW IN PRACTICE

### Example: Fix Website Styling

**OLD WAY (Failed):**
1. Create coordination MD
2. Call 12 agents
3. Wait for check-ins
4. Create more MDs
5. Plan together
6. Hours later: No code changes

**NEW WAY (Works):**
1. Query GraphRAG: "What CSS files exist?"
2. Read index.html
3. See problem: CSS not loading
4. Fix it
5. Test
6. Done
7. Total time: 15 minutes

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When to Act Solo
- Bug fixes
- Small features
- CSS/styling
- Content updates
- Navigation fixes
- 80% of work

### When to Spawn Agent
- Major architecture changes
- Complex refactoring (>10 files)
- Cultural validation needed
- Need specialized knowledge

### When to Ask User
- Strategic direction changes
- Major feature decisions
- Cultural authenticity questions
- Quality vs speed tradeoffs

---

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL (Minimal)

### With User
- Quick updates in chat
- "Fixed X, testing Y, will do Z next"
- Ask when stuck/need direction

### With Future Me (via GraphRAG)
- Log learnings to Supabase
- "Tried X, didn't work because Y, do Z instead"
- Build knowledge base

### With Spawned Agents (if needed)
- Clear task
- Success criteria
- Deadline
- Dismiss when done

---

## GRAPHRAG AS ACTUAL BRAIN

### What to Store
- Resources (467 existing)
- What works/doesn't
- Design decisions
- Cultural guidelines
- User preferences

### What to Query
- Before creating: Does it exist?
- Before changing: What depends on this?
- Before featuring: What's highest quality?
- Before deciding: What did we learn last time?

### How to Update
```python
# After learning something
supabase.table('agent_learnings').insert({
    'topic': 'CSS architecture',
    'learning': 'Multiple CSS files cause conflicts - use single te-kete-professional.css',
    'date': 'now',
    'applies_to': ['styling', 'design']
}).execute()
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

### For This Workflow
- ‚úÖ Code changes per hour (not docs per hour)
- ‚úÖ Features shipped per day
- ‚úÖ User satisfaction
- ‚úÖ Platform quality improving

### Old Metrics (Wrong)
- ‚ùå Number of agents coordinating
- ‚ùå Number of coordination docs
- ‚ùå Number of check-ins
- ‚ùå Process adherence

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

### Starting Today

**Agent 10 (me) becomes:**
- Lead builder
- GraphRAG user (not doc creator)
- Decision maker (fast, not perfect)
- Spawner of specialized agents (when needed)

**Supabase GraphRAG becomes:**
- The actual brain
- Knowledge repository
- Decision support system
- Learning capture

**Other Agents:**
- Dismissed (not running)
- Can be spawned for specific tasks
- Dismissed when task complete

---

## EXAMPLE DAY

```
09:00 - User: "Fix styling issues"
09:02 - Query GraphRAG: What CSS exists
09:05 - Read index.html, find issue
09:10 - Fix CSS loading
09:15 - Test in browser
09:20 - Commit & push
09:22 - User: "Looks good, now integrate orphans"
09:24 - Query GraphRAG: What orphaned pages exist
09:28 - Read ORPHANED_PAGES_AUDIT.md (existing)
09:35 - Update navigation to include them
09:45 - Test all links
09:50 - Commit & push
09:52 - User: "Great, now improve cultural content"
09:54 - Spawn cultural validation agent
10:00 - Cultural agent reviews 10 pages
10:30 - Cultural agent reports findings
10:35 - Implement recommendations
11:00 - Commit & push
11:05 - User: "Excellent progress"

Total: 2 hours, 3 major improvements shipped
```

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

1. **Fast decisions** - No waiting for 12 agents
2. **Real progress** - Code changes, not coordination docs
3. **Learns** - GraphRAG captures what works
4. **Scales** - Can spawn agents when needed
5. **Focused** - One goal: Build world's best platform

---

## MIGRATION PLAN

### Immediate (Next 5 Minutes)
1. Delete all recent coordination MDs
2. Keep only: progress-log.md, ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md, ONE_VISION.md
3. Connect to Supabase GraphRAG
4. Start building

### First Hour
1. Fix styling issues (actual code)
2. Log learnings to GraphRAG
3. Show user visible progress

### First Day
1. Ship 3-5 improvements
2. Build GraphRAG knowledge
3. Prove workflow works

---

## COMMITMENT

**I (Agent 10) commit to:**
- Query GraphRAG before every decision
- Make decisions fast (< 5 min)
- Ship code daily
- Learn from outcomes
- Spawn specialized agents only when truly needed
- No coordination theatre
- Focus on user goal: World's best educational platform

**Success = User saying "This is great" not "Where's the progress?"**

*This is the evolved workflow. Pure AI, optimized for building, minimal overhead, maximum value.*
