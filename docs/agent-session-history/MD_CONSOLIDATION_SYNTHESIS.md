## üìä CONTRADICTIONS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Resource Count Discrepancies
- **Thesis:** "721 resources" (NAVIGATION_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN)
- **Antithesis:** "706 resources" (MANGAKOTUKUTUKU-ALPHA-DEPLOYMENT)
- **Antithesis:** "467 resources in GraphRAG" (HANDOFF_TO_NEW_AGENTS)
- **Antithesis:** "6,699 HTML files total" (content-treasure-hunter.py)
- **SYNTHESIS:** Multiple resource sets at different states:
  - 467 fully curated in GraphRAG (production)
  - 706 in alpha deployment package
  - 721 counted in navigation audit
  - 6,699 total discovered (many need fixing)
  - **DECISION:** Prioritize 467 curated ‚Üí integrate 46 orphaned ‚Üí systematically process remaining 6,186

### 2. Quality vs. Quantity Tension
- **Thesis:** "Process 6,699 files quickly" (treasure hunt mentality)
- **Antithesis:** "6-level nested completeness for every resource" (COMPREHENSIVE_NESTED_EDUCATION_SYSTEM)
- **SYNTHESIS:** Tiered approach:
  - **Tier 1 (Exemplar):** Y8 Systems, Walker, Hƒìrangi - 6-level complete (9-10/10)
  - **Tier 2 (Professional):** Core curriculum resources - 4-level complete (7-8/10)
  - **Tier 3 (Usable):** Supplementary materials - 2-level complete (6/10)
  - **DECISION:** Score files 0-10, enrich to appropriate tier based on usage priority

### 3. Cultural Validation Process
- **Thesis:** "100% culturally appropriate content" (deployment requirement)
- **Antithesis:** "Process thousands of files quickly" (efficiency pressure)
- **SYNTHESIS:** Cultural validation checkpoints:
  - Automated scan for te reo MƒÅori accuracy (macrons, spelling)
  - Flag culturally sensitive content for manual review
  - Prioritize house leader units for cultural advisor verification
  - Use existing validated resources as templates

### 4. Navigation: Multiple Competing Systems
- **Thesis:** Various index.html files with different approaches
- **ANTITHESIS:** Need single coherent navigation
- **SYNTHESIS:** (Still to do - dialectical comparison of all index/nav files)
