# üîÑ KAITIAKI ARONUI CONTINUATION HANDOFF
**Session End:** October 13, 2025
**Tokens Used:** ~310k / 1M  
**Next Agent:** Continue as Kaitiaki Aronui Overseer

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

1. **Proper Onboarding:** Read Master KB, Kaitiaki Brain Manifest, handoff docs
2. **Systems Verified:** MCP (port 3002), GraphRAG (512 resources), localhost (8888)
3. **Scope Identified:** 6,699 HTML files, 5,794 analyzed, 121 MD planning docs
4. **Context Understood:** Mangak≈çtukutuku College - 1000+ students, community mission
5. **Quality Standard:** Y8 Systems Unit = exemplar (9.5/10, 6-level nested)
6. **Tools Located:** content-treasure-hunter.py, agent_graphrag_coordinator.py
7. **First Fix Made:** Corrected breadcrumb path in algebraic-thinking file

---

## üéØ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### STEP 1: Dialectical MD Consolidation (2-4 hours)
**WHY FIRST:** 121 divergent planning docs cause confusion  
**PROCESS:**
1. Read all 121 MDs systematically
2. Extract unique valuable insights
3. Identify contradictions
4. Synthesize into TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
5. Archive or delete redundant MDs

**DIALECTICAL QUESTIONS FOR EACH MD:**
- What unique insight does this contain?
- Does it contradict other plans?
- Is this still relevant for Mangak≈çtukutuku context?
- Keep, merge, or discard?

### STEP 2: Quality Rubric Definition (30 min)
**BASED ON:** Y8 Systems Unit exemplar  
**CREATE:** Scoring rubric (0-10 scale)
- Cultural authenticity (0-3 points)
- Educational completeness (0-3 points)
- Technical quality (0-2 points)
- Usability for teachers (0-2 points)

### STEP 3: Systematic File Processing (Days)
**BATCH SIZE:** 50-100 files per batch  
**PROCESS PER FILE:**
1. Dialectical assessment (keep/fix/discard)
2. Quality score against rubric
3. Fix if >6/10 potential
4. Cultural validation
5. Integration decision

**COORDINATION:** Parallel agents through MCP

### STEP 4: Navigation Synthesis (4-6 hours)
**AFTER:** Files processed  
**DIALECTICAL COMPARISON:**
- All index.html variations
- All navigation systems
- Synthesize best solution
- Implement unified nav

## üß† DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY

**For Each Item (MD, File, System):**

**THESIS:** What is this claiming to be?  
**ANTITHESIS:** What are the problems/contradictions?  
**SYNTHESIS:** What's the truth? (Keep, fix, discard, merge)

**CRITICAL THINKING:**
- Is this actually useful for Mangak≈çtukutuku teachers?
- Does this honor mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori authentically?
- Would we show this to cultural advisors with pride?
- Does this meet Y8 Systems quality standard?

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS TO USE

### GraphRAG Queries
```bash
python3 supabase_graphrag_connector.py search agent-X "topic"
```

### Agent Coordination
```python
from agent_graphrag_coordinator import AgentCoordinator
overseer = AgentCoordinator('kaitiaki-aronui', 'Overseer')
overseer.check_in('Current task')
overseer.log_progress('update', 'Message')
```

### Content Analysis
```bash
python3 scripts/content-treasure-hunter.py discover  # Already done
python3 scripts/content-treasure-hunter.py plan      # Generate integration plan
```

### Knowledge Update
```bash
python3 scripts/local_knowledge_update.py  # Add discoveries to GraphRAG
```

## üìä CURRENT STATE

**Systems:**
- MCP: localhost:3002 (running, PID 11068)
- Site: localhost:8888 (for testing)
- GraphRAG: 512 resources (Supabase) + 163 (local)
- Git: 504 unstaged changes

**Data:**
- content-discovery-results.json: 5,794 files analyzed
- categorized-content.json: By type (2,753 lessons, 2,257 handouts, etc.)
- te_kete_knowledge_graph.json: Local knowledge graph

**Agents (via MCP):**
- Agent-2: Coordinating (styling)
- Agent-10: Active (coordination)
- Others: Offline but assigned tasks

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **Don't create new MDs** - Use TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
2. **Don't process without quality gates** - Use rubric
3. **Don't ignore Mangak≈çtukutuku context** - Serve their needs
4. **Don't skip cultural validation** - Essential for authenticity
5. **Don't work solo** - Coordinate through MCP and progress-log.md

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You'll know you're succeeding when:**
- 121 MDs ‚Üí 1 comprehensive master document
- Quality rubric applied to all files
- Files processed in systematic batches
- Agents coordinating through MCP
- Progress documented in progress-log.md
- Mangak≈çtukutuku-specific needs prioritized

---

## üìû HOW TO CONTINUE

1. **Read:** This document + progress-log.md (last 50 lines)
2. **Check:** MCP server status, agent coordination
3. **Start:** Step 1 (MD consolidation) using dialectical method
4. **Coordinate:** Other agents through MCP for parallel work
5. **Document:** Update progress-log.md every hour
6. **Evolve:** Get smarter with each batch processed
