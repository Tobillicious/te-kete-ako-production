## üéØ UTILIZATION STRATEGY FOR MANGAK≈åTUKUTUKU

### Phase 1: VALIDATE GOLD STANDARD CONTENT (Priority 1)
**Target:** Walker, Hƒìrangi, Y8 Systems, Guided Inquiry

**Actions:**
1. Verify these 5 complete units are fully functional
2. Test all navigation links
3. Ensure cultural authenticity
4. Add to featured content
5. Promote to teachers

**Why:** These are 9.5/10 quality, ready for immediate classroom use

### Phase 2: AUDIT HANDOUTS (941 files)
**Target:** public/handouts/ directory

**Process:**
1. Sample 100 handouts randomly
2. Score using quality rubric (0-10)
3. Categorize by:
   - Subject (Math, Science, English, Social Studies)
   - Year level (7-13)
   - Quality tier (Exemplar/Professional/Usable/Needs Work)
4. Identify top 100 handouts (7-10/10)
5. Fix technical issues in top 100
6. Feature prominently

**Why:** 941 handouts is overwhelming - curate the best

### Phase 3: COMPLETE HOUSE LEADER UNITS
**Target:** Walker ‚úÖ, Hƒìrangi ‚úÖ, Ngata ‚ùå, Hopa ‚ùå, Rickard ‚ùå, Wƒìtere ‚ùå

**Actions:**
1. Walker & Hƒìrangi are complete - promote them
2. Check if Ngata/Hopa/Rickard/Wƒìtere exist partially
3. Prioritize completing one more unit (Ngata recommended)
4. Use Walker as template for structure

**Why:** Mangak≈çtukutuku's curriculum is built around 6 house leaders

### Phase 4: FIX CRITICAL TECHNICAL ISSUES
**Target:** All 1,636 production files

**Automated fixes:**
1. CSS paths (1,055 files with relative paths)
2. Missing professional CSS (983 files)
3. Duplicate DOCTYPE (68 files)
4. Navigation breadcrumbs (106 files missing)

**Script:** Extend `fix-generated-resources-technical.py` to all files

**Why:** Technical quality affects usability

### Phase 5: BROKEN LINKS REMEDIATION
**Target:** 1,200+ files with broken links

**Process:**
1. Generate broken link report
2. Categorize by severity (1-2 links vs 20+ links)
3. Fix high-traffic pages first (index, curriculum, lessons hub)
4. Batch fix common patterns
5. Remove dead links to non-existent content

**Why:** Broken links frustrate teachers

### Phase 6: NAVIGATION COMPLETENESS
**Target:** Hub pages and discovery

**Actions:**
1. Ensure all gold standard content is featured
2. Create subject-based navigation (Math, Science, etc.)
3. Year-level filtering (Y7-Y13)
4. Search functionality
5. "New teacher" onboarding path

**Why:** Teachers need to discover content easily
