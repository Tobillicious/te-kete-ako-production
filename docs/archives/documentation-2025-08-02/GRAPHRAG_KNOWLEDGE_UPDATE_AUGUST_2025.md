# GraphRAG Knowledge Update - August 2025
## Te Kete Ako Platform Evolution

### 🧠 CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR GRAPHRAG

#### **PROJECT ARONUI Legacy**
- Original project name for Te Kete Ako platform development
- Comprehensive educational platform for Aotearoa New Zealand
- Focused on culturally responsive, Te Ao Māori integrated education
- Documentation may have been deleted but knowledge patterns remain in codebase

#### **Authentication Crisis - Gemini's Unauthorized Changes**
- **ISSUE:** Gemini modified Supabase authentication without being asked
- **PROBLEM:** Created mismatched URL/API key pairs
  - URL: `https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co` (CORRECT)
  - API Key: Contains `"ref":"kpawkfxdqzhrhumlutjw"` (WRONG PROJECT)
- **IMPACT:** Users cannot authenticate, sign-up/login fails
- **SOLUTION:** Need correct API keys from nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq project dashboard

#### **Y8 Systems Gold Standard Methodology**
- **PROVEN PATTERN:** Comprehensive lesson packages with:
  1. Multiple integrated resources per lesson (3-4 handouts)
  2. Station rotation activities (20+ minutes each)
  3. Print-ready materials with download links
  4. Cross-platform resource connections
  5. Culturally responsive assessment frameworks
  6. External resource enrichment via exa.ai

#### **Unit 1 Te Ao Māori TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE**
- **NEW RESOURCES ADDED:**
  - `units/resources/unit-1-lesson-1-whakapapa-template.html`
  - `units/resources/unit-1-lesson-1-whakapapa-deep-dive-activities.html` (4 stations)
  - `units/resources/unit-1-lesson-2-tikanga-scenarios.html`
  - `units/resources/unit-1-lesson-3-matauranga-inquiry-cards.html` (12 knowledge areas)
  - `units/resources/unit-1-assessment-portfolio-rubric.html` (holistic assessment)

#### **Experiences Directory Goldmine Activated**
- **LOCATION:** `/experiences/index.html` - Professional hub created
- **PLATFORMS:** Virtual Marae, Digital Pūrākau, Adaptive Pathways, Cultural Assessment
- **STATUS:** Ready for integration with all lesson content
- **POTENTIAL:** Can transform platform from good → world-class

#### **GraphRAG as Persistent Brain**
- **CONNECTIONS DISCOVERED:**
  - Māori Astronomy handout → whakapapa lessons (navigation/identity connection)
  - Writers Toolkit PEEL → Unit 1 reflection writing
  - Urban Māori Identity → contemporary Te Ao Māori applications
  - Environmental Literacy Framework → kaitiakitanga connections
- **INTEGRATION PATTERNS:** Every new resource links to 3-4 existing platform resources
- **SCALING METHOD:** Use GraphRAG to discover connections before creating new content

#### **Cultural Authenticity Framework**
- **APPROACH:** Māori values embedded throughout (manaakitanga, whakatōhea, kaitiaki)
- **ASSESSMENT:** Holistic, mana-enhancing rather than deficit-focused
- **GUIDANCE:** Cultural protocols and safety in all activities
- **INTEGRATION:** Te Reo Māori, whakataukī, authentic contexts throughout

#### **Platform Architecture Understanding**
- **CURRENT STATE:** 216+ enriched educational resources
- **STRENGTHS:** Comprehensive handouts, games, units, lessons
- **UNDERUTILIZED:** Experiences directory, guided-inquiry-unit, cross-connections
- **SCALING READY:** Y8 Systems methodology proven for replication

#### **Next Phase Priorities**
1. **Authentication Fix:** Get correct Supabase API keys
2. **Depth Scaling:** Apply Y8 methodology to Units 2-7
3. **Experience Integration:** Connect advanced platforms to lessons
4. **GraphRAG Utilization:** Continuous knowledge discovery
5. **NZ Curriculum Coverage:** Systematic gap filling
