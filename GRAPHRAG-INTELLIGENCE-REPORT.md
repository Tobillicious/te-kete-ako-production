---

## 🚨 PRIORITY 1: ISOLATED HIGH-QUALITY RESOURCES (Orphaned Treasures)

### **The Problem:**
GraphRAG identified **exceptional resources with HIGH quality but LOW discoverability**:

| Resource | Quality Score | Connections | Issue |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Decolonized Assessment Framework** | 96/100 | **0** | 🚨 COMPLETELY ISOLATED |
| **Wordsearch: Patterns & Algebra** | 95/100 | **0** | 🚨 COMPLETELY ISOLATED |
| **Whakataukī Wisdom Hub** | 97/100 | **4** | Needs more links |
| **Cross-Curricular Bridge Finder** | 96/100 | **8** | Underconnected |
| **Ranginui Walker Unit** | 96/100 | **3** | Underconnected |

### **The Impact:**
- Teachers can't find these gems 😞
- Students miss exceptional learning opportunities
- High-quality cultural content remains hidden
- Investment in content creation wasted

### **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

✅ **Immediate:**
1. Add `/decolonized-assessment-framework.html` to:
   - Teacher Resources hub
   - Professional Development section
   - All subject hub "Assessment" sections

2. Link Patterns & Algebra wordsearch to:
   - Y7 Mathematics unit  
   - Games & Activities section
   - Mathematics Hub featured resources

3. Feature Whakataukī Wisdom Hub on:
   - Homepage
   - Every subject hub (cultural context box)
   - Navigation menu

## 💎 PRIORITY 2: CROSS-CURRICULAR GOLDMINES

### **GraphRAG Discovered These Natural Learning Pathways:**

#### **Science ↔ Mathematics** (400 connections!)
```
258 Science → Math connections
142 Math → Science connections
─────────────────────────────
= 400 TOTAL cross-curricular opportunities!
```

**Example Pathways:**
- Genetics → Statistics (data analysis of inheritance)
- Climate Science → Calculus (environmental modeling)
- Physics → Algebra (equations of motion)

#### **Science ↔ Social Studies** (205 connections)
**Example Pathways:**
- Environmental Science → Geography → Kaitiakitanga
- Biotechnology → Ethics → Māori Worldview
- Astronomy → Navigation → Waka Traditions

#### **Critical Thinking ↔ English** (92 connections)
**Example Pathways:**
- Argument Analysis → Persuasive Writing
- Logic → Narrative Structure
- Debate Skills → Essay Writing

### **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

✅ **Create Cross-Curricular Hub Pages:**
1. `/science-math-integration.html` - The 400-connection pathway
2. `/science-social-studies-bridge.html` - Environmental + Cultural
3. `/critical-thinking-literacy-hub.html` - Thinking + Writing

✅ **Add "Related Subjects" Sections:**
- Every Science resource shows related Math resources
- Every Math resource shows Science applications
- Auto-generated via GraphRAG relationships

## 📊 PRIORITY 3: YEAR LEVEL STANDARDIZATION

### **The Problem:**
GraphRAG found **inconsistent year level naming**:

| Format | Example Resources | Issue |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| "Year 7" | Most common | ✅ Standard |
| "Y7" | Some resources | Inconsistent |
| "Year 7-9" | 1 resource | Too broad? |
| "Y7-8" | 1 resource | Different format |
| "y11" | 1 resource | Lowercase! |
| "Year 123" | 1 resource | 🤔 What? |
| "Infrastructure" | 1 resource | Not a year level! |

### **The Impact:**
- Filters don't work properly
- GraphRAG can't build accurate year level progressions
- Search results incomplete

### **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

✅ **Standardize ALL year levels to:**
```
Years 7-8, Years 9-10, Years 11-13
OR
Year 7, Year 8, Year 9, etc.
```

✅ **Create migration script:**
```python
# Fix all inconsistent year_level values in GraphRAG
UPDATE graphrag_resources 
SET year_level = CASE
    WHEN year_level ILIKE 'y7%' THEN 'Year 7'
    WHEN year_level ILIKE 'y8%' THEN 'Year 8'
    WHEN year_level = 'Year 123' THEN 'Years 1-3'
    WHEN year_level = 'Infrastructure' THEN 'Platform'
    ...
END
```

## 🌟 OPPORTUNITY: SEMANTIC LEARNING PATHWAYS

### **What GraphRAG Can Do (But We're Not Using Yet):**

```
Current State:
Student: "I want to learn about genetics"
Platform: Shows genetics lessons ✅

GraphRAG-Powered State:
Student: "I want to learn about genetics"
Platform: Shows intelligent pathway:
  1️⃣ Genetics & Whakapapa (cultural foundation)
  2️⃣ Biotechnology Ethics (Māori worldview)
  3️⃣ Statistical Analysis (data science application)
  4️⃣ Chemistry of Rongoā (traditional knowledge)
  
+ Related pathways in Math, Social Studies, English
+ Prerequisite knowledge automatically identified
+ Cultural context preserved throughout
```

### **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

✅ **Build Intelligent Pathway Engine:**
1. Use `relationship_type = 'prerequisite'` (849 connections)
2. Follow `progression_pathway` relationships
3. Include `shared_cultural_element` (3,745 connections)
4. Generate personalized learning journeys
