## 🎓 TEACHING VARIANTS GOLDMINE

### Discovery:
- **13,042 teaching variant resources**
- Across **7 subjects**
- Tags: `teaching-variant`, `teaching-option`

### What This Means:
For almost every lesson, there are **multiple pedagogical approaches**:
- Differentiated instruction options
- Different teaching styles
- Varied difficulty levels
- Alternative cultural framings
- Diverse learning modalities

### Current Problem:
**These are HIDDEN from teachers!** No UI to browse or discover them.

### Opportunity:
Create a "Teaching Variants Library" page where teachers can:
- Search for alternative teaching approaches
- Compare pedagogical options
- Select variants matching their students' needs
- Filter by difficulty, cultural integration, teaching style

---
