# 🔍 SIDEBAR STATUS - FINAL AUDIT

## ✅ WHAT'S COMPLETE (Good State)

**Lessons (48 total) - ALL HAVE SIDEBARS:**
- 35 unit lessons ✅
- 10 Y8 systems lessons ✅
- 3 systems lessons ✅
- All with Unit Navigation + whakataukī

**Video Activities (7 total) - ALL HAVE 3-COLUMN LAYOUT:**
- Left sidebar (whakataukī + resources) ✅
- Main content ✅
- Right sidebar (differentiation + NZC) ✅

**Handouts (~45) - MIXED:**
- Some already have sidebars (from previous work)
- Some intentionally don't (A4 print worksheets)
- Some NEED them but missing

## ❌ PAGES THAT NEED SIDEBARS (User Request)

Let me properly audit and fix ONLY those that truly need them:
- Exclude: Games (except wordles fine either way)
- Exclude: A4 print worksheets
- Exclude: Index pages
- Include: Content pages with main-container

Need to be methodical and not create duplicates!

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. Audit handouts properly (check which already have, which need)
2. Add sidebars ONLY where missing
3. Verify no duplicates
4. Test whakataukī injection
5. Final commit
