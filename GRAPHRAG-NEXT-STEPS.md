## üéØ Phase 2: What We Need to Build

### **Priority 1: Update with Real Data**

**CRITICAL:** Hub pages currently show estimated connection counts. Need to:

1. **Query actual connection counts** for "Most Connected Resources" sections
2. **Replace hardcoded badges** (72, 35, 32 connections) with real data
3. **Add "why it's connected" explanations** based on relationship types

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Query for real connection counts
SELECT 
  r.file_path,
  r.title,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rel.id) as total_connections,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rel.relationship_type = 'prerequisite' THEN 1 END) as prereqs,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rel.relationship_type = 'shared_cultural_element' THEN 1 END) as cultural
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel 
  ON (r.file_path = rel.source_path OR r.file_path = rel.target_path)
WHERE r.file_path = '/public/generated-resources-alpha/...'
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title
```

---

### **Priority 2: Visual Knowledge Graph**

**Build Interactive Visualization:**

**File:** `/public/graphrag-knowledge-graph-viz.html`

**Features:**
- D3.js or Cytoscape.js visualization
- Show resources as nodes
- Show relationships as edges
- Color-code by subject
- Size nodes by connection count
- Filter by relationship type
- Click to navigate to resource

**Use Cases:**
- Teachers explore content networks
- Students see learning pathways
- Identify resource gaps
- Discover cultural connections

---

### **Priority 3: Prerequisite Chain Explorer**

**Build Learning Pathway Tool:**

**File:** `/public/graphrag-pathway-explorer.html`

**Features:**
- Input: Starting resource
- Output: Full prerequisite chain visualization
- Show confidence scores
- Estimate total learning time
- Export to lesson plan
- Cultural elements highlighted

**Example Chain:**
```
Patterns & Sequences (L1)
  ‚Üì prerequisite (1.0 confidence)
Mystery of X (L2)
  ‚Üì prerequisite (1.0 confidence)
Building with Algebra (L3)
  ‚Üì prerequisite (0.92 confidence)
Balancing Act (L4)
  ‚Üì prerequisite (0.92 confidence)
Two-Step Shuffle (L5)
```

---

### **Priority 4: Expand to Missing Hubs**

**Social Studies Hub:**
- Query social studies resources
- Find cultural connections
- Build Te Tiriti pathways
- Link to Treaty settlement data viz

**Te Reo MƒÅori Hub:**
- Cultural excellence network (2,400 relationships!)
- Shared whakataukƒ´ connections
- Te reo integration across subjects

**Digital Technologies Hub:**
- 586 resources with 368 cultural
- Coding with MƒÅori patterns
- Digital kaitiakitanga unit

---

### **Priority 5: Intelligent Search**

**GraphRAG-Powered Search:**

**File:** `/public/components/graphrag-search.html`

**Features:**
- Semantic search (not just keywords)
- "Find related to..." queries
- Cultural context filtering
- Quality score ranking
- Year level filtering
- Subject cross-references

**Example Queries:**
```
"Resources like genetics" 
  ‚Üí Returns: Genetics, Whakapapa, Biotechnology Ethics, DNA

"Prerequisites for calculus"
  ‚Üí Returns: Full algebra ‚Üí trigonometry ‚Üí calculus chain

"MƒÅori cultural + science"
  ‚Üí Returns: Resources with shared_cultural_element relationships
```

---

### **Priority 6: Teacher Dashboard**

**Build GraphRAG Analytics for Teachers:**

**File:** `/public/teacher-graphrag-dashboard.html`

**Metrics to Show:**
- Most connected resources in their subject
- Cultural integration percentage
- Prerequisite gap analysis
- Student pathway suggestions
- Resource quality trends
- Cross-curricular opportunities

---

### **Priority 7: Real-Time Recommendations**

**Context-Aware Suggestions:**

Currently components query on page load. Need:

1. **User behavior tracking:**
   - Resources viewed in session
   - Time spent on each
   - Download history

2. **Smart recommendations:**
   - "Students who used X also found Y helpful"
   - "Based on your Year 10 class, try..."
   - "Complete this pathway: 3 more resources"

3. **Cultural pathways:**
   - "Explore whakapapa across subjects"
   - "Follow kaitiakitanga theme"
   - "Te reo integration journey"

---

## üîß Technical Debt to Address

### **1. Consolidate Supabase Keys**
Currently multiple anon keys in components. Centralize:
```javascript
// Create /public/js/graphrag-config.js
export const GRAPHRAG_CONFIG = {
  supabaseUrl: 'https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co',
  supabaseKey: '[single-key-here]'
};
```

### **2. Error Handling**
Components fail silently. Add:
- Loading states
- Error messages
- Retry logic
- Fallback content

### **3. Performance**
Some queries are slow. Optimize:
- Add database indexes
- Cache frequent queries
- Pagination for large results
- Lazy load components

### **4. Testing**
No tests yet. Build:
- Query validation tests
- Component render tests
- Relationship integrity checks
- Performance benchmarks

---

## üìä Data Quality Improvements

### **1. Fill Missing Relationships**
Found gaps in relationship data:
- Generated resources have 0 prerequisite relationships
- Need to analyze content and create connections
- Use AI to suggest relationships?

### **2. Confidence Score Calibration**
Some relationships have low confidence. Review:
- Relationship types with <0.75 confidence
- Validate against actual pedagogy
- Teacher review process

### **3. Cultural Context Expansion**
8,421 resources marked cultural_context=true. Enhance:
- Add specific cultural elements (whakataukƒ´ names, concepts)
- Tag cultural competency level
- Link to cultural advisories

---

## üé® UX Enhancements

### **1. Connection Count Visualization**
Instead of just "118 connections", show:
```
üîó 118 Total Connections
  ‚îú‚îÄ 45 Same Subject
  ‚îú‚îÄ 32 Cultural Elements
  ‚îú‚îÄ 24 Related Content
  ‚îú‚îÄ 12 Cross-Curricular
  ‚îî‚îÄ 5 Prerequisites
```

### **2. Pathway Preview Cards**
When showing learning pathways, add:
- Estimated time: "3 weeks at 2hrs/week"
- Difficulty progression: "üü¢ ‚Üí üü° ‚Üí üî¥"
- Cultural density: "85% culturally integrated"
- Student testimonials (future)

### **3. Interactive Relationship Explorer**
Click any resource ‚Üí see its graph neighborhood:
- Direct connections (1-hop)
- Extended network (2-hop)
- Paths to specific goals
- Similar resources

## üí° Key Insights from GraphRAG Analysis

**What We Learned:**
1. **Connection density varies**: Some resources have 100+ connections, others <10
2. **Prerequisite chains are perfect**: Algebra unit has confidence=1.0 chains
3. **Cultural integration is strong**: 5,062 shared cultural element relationships
4. **Cross-curricular links exist**: 1,200 relationships identified
5. **Quality clusters**: Excellence resources form networks (2,300 relationships)

**What This Means:**
- Hub resources are well-connected (good!)
- Orphaned resources need better integration
- Cultural threads run through entire platform
- Teachers can build coherent pathways
- Students have clear progression routes

**Future State:**
- Every resource knows its place in the knowledge graph
- Students see personalized pathways
- Teachers discover connections automatically
- Cultural knowledge threads visible
- Cross-curricular integration seamless
