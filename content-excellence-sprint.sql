-- CONTENT EXCELLENCE SPRINT - PHASE 1: DISCOVERY
-- Identify top-quality resources for cultural enhancement

-- ============================================
-- 1. IDENTIFY TARGET RESOURCES
-- ============================================

-- Find high-quality resources (90+ score) with cultural integration potential
SELECT 
    id,
    title,
    file_path,
    content_type,
    quality_score,
    cultural_level,
    (quality_score + cultural_level) as combined_score
FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE quality_score >= 90 
AND cultural_level < 80  -- Need cultural enhancement
ORDER BY quality_score DESC, cultural_level ASC
LIMIT 25;

-- ============================================
-- 2. CULTURAL INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES
-- ============================================

-- Find resources with high quality but low cultural integration
SELECT 
    content_type,
    COUNT(*) as resource_count,

FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE quality_score >= 85
GROUP BY content_type
ORDER BY enhancement_potential DESC;

-- ============================================
-- 3. EXISTING CULTURAL EXCELLENCE PATTERNS
-- ============================================

-- Find resources that already have high cultural integration for pattern analysis
SELECT 
    title,
    file_path,
    cultural_level,
    quality_score,
    LEFT(content, 200) as content_preview
FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE cultural_level >= 90 
AND quality_score >= 90
ORDER BY cultural_level DESC, quality_score DESC
LIMIT 15;

-- ============================================
-- 4. SUBJECT-SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES
-- ============================================

-- Identify subjects with high quality but low cultural integration

    AVG(quality_score - cultural_level) as enhancement_potential
FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE quality_score >= 85
GROUP BY subject_area
ORDER BY enhancement_potential DESC;

-- ============================================
-- 5. RELATIONSHIP OPPORTUNITIES
-- ============================================

-- Find relationship types that could connect cultural concepts
SELECT 
    relationship_type,
    COUNT(*) as relationship_count,
    AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type ILIKE '%cultural%' 
   OR relationship_type ILIKE '%mƒÅori%'
