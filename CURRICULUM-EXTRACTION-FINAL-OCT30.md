2. ✅ Found 120 TRUE duplicates (same statement in same phase)
3. ✅ Executed systematic SQL cleanup
4. ✅ Verified ZERO duplicates remain
5. ✅ Confirmed English & Mathematics were in database (different curriculum_version)

### **Quality Metrics:**

### **Duplicate Removal Details:**
```sql

-- After cleanup: 3,445 statements
-- Duplicates removed: 120 statements

DELETE FROM curriculum_statements
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM (
    SELECT id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
             PARTITION BY learning_area, phase, statement_text 
             ORDER BY id
           ) AS rn
    FROM curriculum_statements

## 💡 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **Quality Assurance is Critical:**
1. **User Question Saved Us:** "Are we not accidentally making doubles now?"
   - Triggered comprehensive audit
   - Found 120 duplicates we missed
   - Systematic cleanup ensured zero duplicates

2. **Always Verify Totals:**
   - Don't assume previous session data is current
   - Check both curriculum_version values
   - Verify with SQL queries, not assumptions

3. **True Duplicates vs Expected Duplicates:**
   - **TRUE DUPLICATE**: Same statement in same phase (ERROR ❌)
   - **EXPECTED**: Same statement in different phases (CORRECT ✅)
   - Always partition by phase when checking duplicates

### **Future Extraction Protocol:**
1. Extract content systematically
2. Check for duplicates DURING extraction
3. Verify totals against expected counts
4. Get user verification on sources and completion
5. Final comprehensive duplicate check
6. Document all sources with URLs and dates
