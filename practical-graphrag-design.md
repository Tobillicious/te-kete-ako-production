# üï∏Ô∏è Practical GraphRAG for Te Kete Ako Knowledge Management

## Vision: Comprehensive Educational Knowledge Graph

A GraphRAG system that creates a living knowledge graph of all Te Kete Ako resources, relationships, and context to enable intelligent discovery and management of educational content.

## Core Knowledge Entities

### 1. Educational Resources
- **Lesson Plans**: All individual lessons with metadata
- **Unit Plans**: Multi-lesson sequences and progressions  
- **Handouts**: Supporting materials and worksheets
- **Interactive Tools**: Games, digital activities, assessments
- **Cultural Content**: MƒÅori language, cultural protocols, whakataukƒ´

### 2. Relationship Mapping
- **Prerequisites**: What students need to know before each lesson
- **Progressions**: How lessons build on each other
- **Cross-Curricular Links**: Connections between subjects
- **Cultural Integration**: How Te Ao MƒÅori concepts weave through content
- **Assessment Relationships**: How activities connect to learning outcomes

### 3. Contextual Information
- **Agent Knowledge**: Previous session notes, completed work, known issues
- **Project Status**: What's been built, what's missing, deployment status
- **Student Pathways**: Recommended learning sequences
- **Teacher Support**: Pedagogical guidance and differentiation strategies

## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Construction
```javascript
// Entity extraction from existing resources
const entities = {
  lessons: extractLessonsFromFiles(),
  culturalConcepts: extractMƒÅoriConcepts(),
  learningObjectives: extractObjectives(),
  resources: extractSupportingMaterials(),
  assessments: extractAssessmentCriteria()
};

// Relationship mapping
const relationships = {
  prerequisite: mapPrerequisites(),
  cultural_integration: mapCulturalConnections(),
  curriculum_alignment: mapToNZCurriculum(),
  difficulty_progression: mapDifficultyLevels(),
  cross_curricular: mapSubjectConnections()
};
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Retrieval System
```javascript
// GraphRAG query system
class TeKeteGraphRAG {
  async findRelatedContent(query, context) {
    // 1. Parse intent (lesson planning, cultural integration, assessment)
    const intent = await this.parseIntent(query);
    
    // 2. Traverse knowledge graph for relevant nodes
    const relevantNodes = await this.graphTraversal(intent, context);
    
    // 3. Rank by cultural authenticity, pedagogical effectiveness
    const rankedContent = await this.rankByCriteria(relevantNodes);
    
    // 4. Generate contextual response with recommendations
    return await this.generateResponse(rankedContent, context);
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Agent Context Management
```javascript
// Persistent agent memory across sessions
const agentContext = {
  previousSessions: loadSessionHistory(),
  completedTasks: loadCompletedWork(),
  knownIssues: loadKnownProblems(),
  userPreferences: loadUserPreferences(),
  projectStatus: loadCurrentState()
};
```

## Knowledge Graph Schema

### Core Node Types
- **Lesson**: Individual teaching sessions
- **Concept**: Learning concepts (both academic and cultural)
- **Resource**: Supporting materials and tools
- **Objective**: Learning outcomes and success criteria
- **Cultural_Element**: MƒÅori concepts, values, practices
- **Student**: Learner profiles and pathways
- **Teacher**: Educator support and guidance

### Relationship Types
- **BUILDS_ON**: Lesson progression relationships
- **REQUIRES**: Prerequisite knowledge/skills
- **INTEGRATES**: Cultural concept integration
- **SUPPORTS**: Resource-to-lesson relationships  
- **ASSESSES**: Assessment-to-objective relationships
- **EXEMPLIFIES**: Concept-to-example relationships

## Practical Implementation Features

### 1. Intelligent Lesson Discovery
```
Query: "I need a lesson that builds on PEEL method but integrates whakapapa"
GraphRAG Response: 
- Advanced Argument Structure lesson (builds on PEEL)
- Includes whakapapa integration activities
- Connects to Living Whakapapa Project
- Cultural authenticity verified by kaumƒÅtua input
```

### 2. Missing Content Identification
```
Query: "What's missing from our Y8 Systems unit?"
GraphRAG Response:
- Guided inquiry project properly linked (FIXED)
- Assessment rubric for society design
- Cultural validation for decolonized governance content
- Extension activities for advanced learners
```

### 3. Cultural Authenticity Tracking
```
Query: "Which resources need cultural review?"
GraphRAG Response:
- Virtual Marae content (needs kaumƒÅtua validation)
- Traditional knowledge sections (accuracy check needed)
- Te Reo pronunciation guides (audio recordings needed)
```

### 4. Agent Context Continuity
```
Session Start: GraphRAG loads previous context
- Last session: Fixed Supabase RLS issues ‚úì
- Outstanding: Deployment of enhanced content
- User priorities: Cultural authenticity, student engagement
- Known working solutions: Resource integration scripts
```

## Technical Stack

### Graph Database: Neo4j or Memgraph
```cypher
// Example query: Find culturally integrated lessons
MATCH (lesson:Lesson)-[:INTEGRATES]->(cultural:Cultural_Element)
WHERE cultural.concept = 'whakapapa'
RETURN lesson.title, lesson.cultural_integration_level
ORDER BY lesson.effectiveness_rating DESC
```

### Vector Embeddings: Semantic search integration
```javascript
// Combine graph structure with semantic similarity
const hybridSearch = async (query) => {
  const graphResults = await neo4j.query(graphQuery);
  const vectorResults = await vectorDB.search(semanticQuery);
  return combineAndRank(graphResults, vectorResults);
};
```

### LLM Integration: Context-aware responses
```javascript
// Generate responses using graph context
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: buildSystemPrompt(graphContext) },
    { role: "user", content: query }
  ],
  model: "gpt-4"
});
```

## Implementation Benefits

### For Educators
- **Intelligent Discovery**: Find exactly the right lesson for specific needs
- **Cultural Guidance**: Ensure authentic Te Ao MƒÅori integration
- **Progression Mapping**: See how lessons build student understanding
- **Assessment Alignment**: Connect activities to learning outcomes

### for Students  
- **Personalized Pathways**: Adaptive learning sequences
- **Cultural Connection**: Understand how learning connects to identity
- **Prerequisite Clarity**: Know what they need before starting
- **Extension Opportunities**: Find challenges at their level

### For Project Management
- **Context Continuity**: Agents remember previous work and decisions
- **Gap Identification**: Automatically find missing or broken content
- **Quality Assurance**: Track cultural authenticity and pedagogical effectiveness
- **Resource Optimization**: Avoid duplicating existing high-quality content

## Next Steps

1. **Extract Current Knowledge**: Parse existing lesson plans, resources, and documentation
2. **Build Initial Graph**: Create nodes and relationships for core content
3. **Implement Query System**: Enable intelligent content discovery
4. **Add Agent Memory**: Persistent context across coding sessions
5. **Cultural Validation Layer**: Ensure authenticity of MƒÅori content integration

This GraphRAG system would transform Te Kete Ako from a collection of resources into an intelligent, culturally-grounded educational ecosystem that supports both learners and educators while maintaining the highest standards of cultural authenticity and pedagogical excellence.
