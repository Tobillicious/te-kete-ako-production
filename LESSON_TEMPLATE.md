### 5. Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)

| **Time** | **Activity** | **Description & Teacher Guidance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW / Whakawhanaungatanga** | Greet students at the door. A "Do Now" activity should be on the board for students to begin immediately upon entering. This activity should be a short, sharp task to focus their thinking and recap prior learning. |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching / Direct Instruction** | Introduce the Learning Intention (WALT) and Success Criteria. Present the core concepts of the lesson, explicitly connecting to the "Do Now." Use a variety of methods (e.g., short lecture, video clip, demonstration). |
| **15-45 min** | **Guided Practice / Student Activity** | Students work on the main activity of the lesson. The teacher circulates and provides support. Use a WAGOLL to model the expected outcome before students begin. |
| **45-65 min** | **Independent Practice / Application** | Students apply their learning to a new context (e.g., answering an extension question, starting a research task, writing a reflection). |
| **65-75 min** | **Plenary / Wrap-up** | Bring the class back together to review the Learning Intention and Success Criteria. Students share their work or key takeaways. Use this time for formative assessment (e.g., exit ticket, quick quiz). |

### 6. Differentiated Instruction & Extension

*   **For students who need extra support:**
    *   `[e.g., Provide a vocabulary list with definitions and images.]`
    *   `[e.g., Offer a sentence-starter handout for the writing task.]`
*   **For students who need a challenge:**
    *   `[e.g., "What If?" scenario: How might Māori innovation have evolved differently if Cook had never arrived?]`
    *   `[e.g., Research and present on a lesser-known example of Māori technology.]`

---

### 7. Assessment

*   **Formative:**
    *   `[e.g., Teacher observation during group work]`
    *   `[e.g., Exit ticket: "What are two questions you still have about this topic?"]`
*   **Summative:**
    *   `[e.g., This lesson contributes to the end-of-unit inquiry project.]`

---

### 8. Kaiako Notes & Reflections

*   **Culturally Responsive Pedagogy:**
    *   `[e.g., This lesson provides an opportunity to discuss the concept of 'mātauranga Māori' as a valid and sophisticated knowledge system.]`
    *   `[e.g., Be mindful of the diverse backgrounds of students in the classroom and create a safe space for discussion.]`
*   **Post-Lesson Reflection:**
    *   *What went well in this lesson?*
    *   *What would I change for next time?*
    *   *Which students need extra support with this content?*
