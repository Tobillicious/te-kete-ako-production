- Users need access to content
- Better to have 22 good units than 0 perfect ones
- Can improve iteratively with user feedback

**Action Plan:**
1. Fix Y7 Science (ASAP)
2. Choose better Y9 Geometry variant
3. Continue enriching others gradually
4. Monitor user feedback
5. Iterate toward excellence
