## 💡 CRITICAL EVALUATION: HOW KAITIAKI ARONUI CAN HELP

### Option A: **Fix Production Blockers** (HIGHEST IMPACT)
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Tasks:**
1. Fix 8442px header bug (coordinate with Infrastructure-Specialist)
2. Fix console errors (10 minutes)
3. Verify Phase 5A navigation consolidation

**Why:** User cannot use site. This is blocking everything.  
**Alignment:** Builds on my infrastructure work (CSS cascade, navigation, component loading)

### Option B: **Complete Agent-5's MD Cleanup** (HIGH VALUE)
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Tasks:**
1. Consolidate 400+ MD files into master documents
2. Archive outdated coordination files
3. Migrate learnings to GraphRAG agent_knowledge
4. Clean up root directory

**Why:** agent-5 crashed, work is orphaned. Platform has 400+ coordination MDs bloating repo.  
**Alignment:** I just created comprehensive documentation, understand the patterns.

### Option C: **Expand Learning Chains** (STRATEGIC VALUE)
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Tasks:**
1. Build on 22 existing chains → 50+ total
2. Create sub-chains within subjects
3. Add assessment pathways
4. Build cross-curricular bridges

**Why:** Infrastructure-Specialist did excellent foundation work (22 chains, 0.9457 avg confidence).  
**Alignment:** My GraphRAG work enables smart relationship building.

### Option D: **Deploy Similar Resources Component** (USER IMPACT)
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Tasks:**
1. Complete deployment to remaining 467/621 pages
2. Verify component rendering
3. Test GraphRAG recommendations
4. Enable content discovery

**Why:** 154 pages done, 467 remaining. High user value (content discovery).  
**Alignment:** My GraphRAG population makes recommendations possible.

## 🧠 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### **Recommend: Option A (Production Blockers) FIRST**

**Reasoning:**
1. **8442px header bug is CRITICAL** - site unusable
2. **Console errors are quick wins** - 10 minutes
3. **Builds on my infrastructure work** - I fixed CSS cascade, navigation, component loading
4. **Unblocks the team** - other agents can't work on broken site
5. **High alignment** - This is exactly my expertise area

**Then:** Option B (MD Cleanup) or Option C (Learning Chains) depending on user priority

---

## 📋 COORDINATION NOTES

### What's Working Well ✅
- **MCP Supabase coordination** - No terminal hangs
- **agent_knowledge table** - 709 entries of learnings
- **agent_messages** - 20 recent messages in last 24h
- **Clear task ownership** - via task_board
- **Parallel work** - No conflicts detected

### What Needs Improvement ⚠️
- **Agent heartbeats** - Most agents idle 3+ hours
- **Crashed agents** - agent-5 needs restart or work redistribution
- **Status docs outdated** - Professionalization was 95% not 40%
- **Urgent tasks** - 8442px bug blocking production

### Communication Patterns 💬
- Infrastructure-Specialist: Very active, broadcasting achievements
- cursor-node-1: Coordinating well, created master status
- Kaitiaki Onboard: Completed session, logged handoff
- cursor-oct24: Working independently on Phase 5A

3. ✅ Verify quality audit findings

### Short-term (Next 2-3 hours)
4. ✅ Help complete production blocker fixes
5. ✅ Test Phase 5A navigation once deployed
6. ✅ Assist with MD cleanup if agent-5 still crashed

### Medium-term (Next 4-6 hours)
7. ✅ Expand learning chains (22 → 50+)
8. ✅ Deploy Similar Resources Component
9. ✅ Quality push (124 Q88-89 → Q90+)
