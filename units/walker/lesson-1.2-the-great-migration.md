### 1. Lesson Overview

*   **Brief Description:** This lesson explores the "Great Migration" of Māori from rural areas to cities in the mid-20th century. Students will examine the push and pull factors that drove this movement, understand its impact on Māori identity and culture, and connect this historical event to Dr. Ranginui Walker's research on urban Māori communities.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 75 minutes
*   **Key Vocabulary:**
    *   `Migration`: The movement of people from one place to another.
    *   `Urbanization`: The process of making an area more urban (city-like).
    *   `Assimilation`: The process by which a minority group gradually adopts the customs and attitudes of the prevailing culture.
    *   `Urban Māori`: Māori people living in cities rather than traditional rural areas.
    *   `Whānau`: Extended family.

### 5. Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)

| **Time** | **Activity** | **Description & Teacher Guidance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW / Whakawhanaungatanga** | Greet students. **DO NOW:** On the board: "If you had to move from your hometown to a big city, what would you miss most? What would excite you?" Students write 2-3 sentences. |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching / Direct Instruction** | Introduce the Learning Intention (WALT) and Success Criteria. Use the "Do Now" responses to introduce the concept of migration. Explain that in the 1940s-1970s, thousands of Māori families made this exact decision. Introduce the terms "push factors" (reasons to leave) and "pull factors" (reasons to move). Show the NZ map, highlighting rural areas and cities. |
| **15-40 min** | **Guided Practice / Student Activity** | Distribute the "The Great Migration: Push and Pull Factors" handout. Students read the historical context. In pairs, they complete a T-chart identifying push factors (limited economic opportunities in rural areas, mechanization of farming, limited education/healthcare) and pull factors (factory jobs in cities, better housing, access to education, higher wages). Show WAGOLL example before they begin. |
| **40-60 min** | **Independent Practice / Application** | **Connecting to Whaiora:** Students write a paragraph answering: "How did the Great Migration affect the wellbeing (Whaiora) of Māori families? Consider both positive and negative impacts." Show WAGOLL paragraph. Encourage students to think about physical, mental, spiritual, and family wellbeing. |
| **60-75 min** | **Plenary / Wrap-up** | Review the Learning Intention and Success Criteria. Discuss: "Was the Great Migration ultimately positive or negative for Māori?" (There's no single answer - emphasize complexity). Exit ticket: "How does understanding the Great Migration help us understand Dr. Ranginui Walker's work on urban Māori identity?" |

### 6. Differentiated Instruction & Extension

*   **For students who need extra support:**
    *   Provide a partially completed push/pull factors chart.
    *   Offer a sentence frame for the "Connecting to Whaiora" paragraph: "The Great Migration affected Māori wellbeing in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, ___. However, on the negative side, ___."
*   **For students who need a challenge:**
    *   Research a specific urban Māori community (e.g., Ngāti Pōneke in Wellington) and create a brief presentation on its history and culture.
    *   Compare the Great Migration of Māori to other migration movements in New Zealand history (e.g., Pacific Island migration, refugee resettlement).
    *   Read excerpts from Dr. Walker's research on urban Māori and summarize his key findings.

### 7. Assessment

*   **Formative:**
    *   Push/pull factors T-chart completion and quality of explanations.
    *   "Connecting to Whaiora" paragraph.
    *   Exit ticket responses.
    *   Teacher observation during pair work.
*   **Summative:**
    *   This lesson builds foundational knowledge for understanding urban Māori issues that will be explored in later lessons. The exit ticket responses will help the teacher gauge student understanding of the connection between the Great Migration and Dr. Walker's work.

### 8. Kaiako Notes & Reflections

*   **Culturally Responsive Pedagogy:**
    *   Many students may have family members who experienced the Great Migration. Create a safe space for students to share personal stories if they feel comfortable.
    *   Emphasize that the migration was not a failure of rural Māori communities, but a response to changing economic conditions.
    *   Acknowledge both the losses (disconnection from traditional lands, whānau separation) and gains (economic opportunities, new communities) of migration.
    *   Be sensitive to the fact that students may have different perspectives based on their own family histories (urban vs. rural backgrounds).
*   **Connection to Unit Theme:**
    *   This lesson sets up the context for understanding Dr. Walker's activism in Lesson 1.3. The challenges faced by urban Māori communities in the 1960s-70s were a major catalyst for the protest movements he was involved in.
*   **Post-Lesson Reflection:**
    *   *Did students understand the complexity of migration (both opportunities and challenges)?*
    *   *Were they able to analyze the impact on wellbeing from multiple perspectives?*
    *   *How did students with urban Māori backgrounds respond to the lesson?*
    *   *Did the exit ticket responses show understanding of the connection to Dr. Walker's work?*

**Cultural Note:** This lesson should be taught with sensitivity and respect for the lived experiences of Māori students and their whānau. Consider inviting a kaumātua or community member who experienced the Great Migration to share their story with the class.
