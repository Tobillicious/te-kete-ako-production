| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW / Whakawhanaungatanga** | Greet students. **DO NOW:** On the board, have the question: "Who gets to tell the story of a country's history? Why does it matter who tells the story?" Students should write a 2-3 sentence response in their books. |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching / Direct Instruction** | Introduce the Learning Intention (WALT) and Success Criteria.
