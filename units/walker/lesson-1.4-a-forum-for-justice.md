Dr. Ranginui Walker's scholarship on Treaty settlements provides the academic framework for this lesson.

### 5. Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)

| **Time** | **Activity** | **Description & Teacher Guidance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW / Whakawhanaungatanga** | Greet students. **DO NOW:** "If someone broke a promise to you 100 years ago, should they still make it right today? Why or why not?" Students write 2-3 sentences. |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching / Direct Instruction** | Introduce WALT and Success Criteria. Use "Do Now" to introduce the concept of historical justice. Explain: The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) was a promise, but it was broken many times. By the 1970s (Lesson 1.3's protests), Māori demanded a way to address these breaches. In 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal was established. Show timeline: 1975 (established, future claims only) → 1985 (amendment to hear historical claims back to 1840) → 1990s-present (major settlements). Explain Dr. Walker's role in documenting and analyzing this process. |
| **15-40 min** | **Guided Practice / Student Activity** | Distribute "Waitangi Tribunal: A Timeline" handout and case study materials. In pairs, students analyze a case study using a structured framework (show WAGOLL first): 1) **The Grievance** (What was the breach?), 2) **The Evidence** (What proof supported the claim?), 3) **The Findings** (What did the Tribunal decide?), 4) **The Redress** (What compensation was offered?). Pairs create a one-page summary poster. Gallery walk: students view other pairs' posters and note similarities/differences across cases. |
| **40-60 min** | **Independent Practice / Application** | **Connecting to Whaimana:** Students write a paragraph answering: "How does the Waitangi Tribunal demonstrate the value of Whaimana (Integrity)? Do you think the Tribunal has been effective in achieving justice? Why or why not?" Show WAGOLL paragraph. Encourage students to consider both achievements (acknowledging wrongs, providing redress) and limitations (can't undo history, compensation often insufficient, process takes years). |
| **60-75 min** | **Plenary / Wrap-up** | Review WALT and Success Criteria. Class discussion: "Dr. Walker wrote extensively about Treaty settlements. Why is it important that these stories are told and recorded?" Exit ticket: "If you could ask Dr. Ranginui Walker one question about the Tribunal, what would it be?" |

### 6. Differentiated Instruction & Extension

*   **For students who need extra support:**
    *   Provide a simplified case study with key information highlighted.
    *   Offer a template for the case study analysis with sentence starters.
    *   Allow students to create a visual timeline instead of a written paragraph for the "Connecting to Whaimana" task.
*   **For students who need a challenge:**
    *   Research the difference between the English and Māori versions of the Treaty and how this affects Tribunal claims.
    *   Compare Treaty settlements in New Zealand to indigenous rights processes in other countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, USA).
    *   Analyze a recent or ongoing Tribunal claim and present findings to the class.
    *   Debate: "The Tribunal should have the power to enforce its recommendations, not just make them."
    *   Read excerpts from a Waitangi Tribunal report and summarize the Tribunal's reasoning.

### 7. Assessment

*   **Formative:**
    *   Case study analysis poster (completeness, accuracy, analysis).
    *   Gallery walk engagement and notes.
    *   "Connecting to Whaimana" paragraph.
    *   Exit ticket questions.
*   **Summative:**
    *   This lesson provides crucial context for Lesson 1.5 (Ka Whawhai Tonu Mātou), where students will see how Dr. Walker synthesized the history from Lessons 1.1-1.4 into his landmark book. Teacher should assess whether students understand the Tribunal as both an achievement and an ongoing process.

### 8. Kaiako Notes & Reflections

*   **Culturally Responsive Pedagogy:**
    *   **Local Connection:** If possible, focus on a Treaty claim relevant to your region. This makes the lesson personally meaningful and shows students their own place in this history.
    *   **Complexity:** Teach students to think critically about the Tribunal. It was a major achievement, but it's not a perfect solution. Some iwi are satisfied with settlements; others feel the redress is inadequate. Both perspectives are valid.
    *   **Student Perspectives:** Students from different iwi may have different experiences with Treaty settlements. Create space for these diverse perspectives.
    *   **Ongoing Process:** Emphasize that Treaty justice is not "finished." Many claims are still being heard, and the relationship between Māori and the Crown continues to evolve.
*   **Connection to Unit Theme:**
    *   This lesson shows the practical outcome of challenging the dominant narrative (Lesson 1.1), understanding historical grievances (Lesson 1.2), and protesting injustice (Lesson 1.3). The Tribunal is proof that activism can lead to institutional change. This sets up Lesson 1.5, where Dr. Walker's book synthesizes all these themes.
*   **Post-Lesson Reflection:**
    *   *Did students understand how the Tribunal works and why it was created?*
    *   *Were they able to analyze a case study critically?*
    *   *Did the local case study (if used) resonate with students?*
    *   *How did students respond to the complexity of evaluating the Tribunal's effectiveness?*
    *   *Did the exit tickets show engagement with Dr. Walker's role as historian of this process?*

**Teacher Resource:** The Waitangi Tribunal website (waitangitribunal.govt.nz) has excellent summaries, videos, and teaching resources. Consider showing a short video clip from a Tribunal hearing to make the process real for students.

**Historical Context:** The 1985 amendment allowing historical claims was a direct result of continued Māori activism and the work of scholars like Dr. Walker who documented the extent of Treaty breaches. This lesson connects activism (Lesson 1.3) to systemic change.

**Cultural Note:** Some iwi have completed Treaty settlements; others have not. Be sensitive to where your students' iwi are in this process. If in doubt, consult with your school's cultural advisor or local iwi education liaison.
