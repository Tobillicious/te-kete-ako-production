| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW / Whakawhanaungatanga** | Greet students. **DO NOW:** "What qualities make a great leader? Write down three qualities and one example of a leader (historical or contemporary) who has those qualities." Students write 2-3 sentences. |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching / Direct Instruction** | Introduce WALT and Success Criteria. Use "Do Now" to discuss leadership qualities. Explain that this unit focuses on Te Puea Hērangi, a woman who led her people through devastating times. Show her image.

| **15-40 min** | **Guided Practice / Student Activity** | Distribute "Te Puea Hērangi: A Life of Service" handout. Students read about Te Puea's early life, challenges (1918 influenza pandemic, poverty, loss of land), and emergence as leader. In pairs, students create a timeline of Te Puea's life highlighting: 1) **Birth & Early Life** (1883-1910), 2) **Emerging as Leader** (1911-1918), 3) **The Pandemic & Its Aftermath** (1918-1920s).

Consider physical, mental, spiritual, and family wellbeing." Show WAGOLL paragraph before they begin. Encourage students to use specific examples from the handout (e.g., caring for influenza orphans, building housing, restoring marae, providing food). |
| **60-75 min** | **Plenary / Wrap-up** | Review WALT and Success Criteria. Class discussion: "Te Puea is often called 'The Mother of the Nation.' Why do you think she earned this title?" Exit ticket: "What is one challenge Te Puea faced that you want to learn more about in the next lesson?" |

    *   Compare the Kīngitanga to other indigenous sovereignty movements (e.g., Hawaiian Kingdom, Native American tribal sovereignty).

### 8. Kaiako Notes & Reflections

*   **Culturally Responsive Pedagogy:**
    *   **Mana Wahine:** Te Puea is an exceptional example of Māori women's leadership. Emphasize that she led in ways that were both traditional (through whakapapa, cultural knowledge) and innovative (adapting to modern challenges).
    *   **Waikato Context:** If teaching in the Waikato region, this lesson is especially significant as it's local history. Students may have whānau connections to Tainui or Tūrangawaewae. Create space for these stories.
    *   **Respect for Kīngitanga:** The Kīngitanga is a living institution. The current Māori King, Kiingi Tuheitia, continues this tradition. Teach with respect and accuracy.
    *   **Wellbeing Framework:** Te Puea's work aligns with Te Whare Tapa Whā (the four-sided house model of Māori health). Connect her leadership to this holistic wellbeing framework.
*   **Connection to Unit Theme:**
    *   This lesson introduces "The Heart of the Kīngitanga" - Te Puea's unwavering commitment to her people's wellbeing despite enormous obstacles. Lessons 2.2-2.5 will explore how she put this commitment into action through specific challenges and achievements.
*   **Post-Lesson Reflection:**
    *   *Did students grasp the significance of the Kīngitanga?*
    *   *Were they able to understand whakapapa and its importance in Māori leadership?*
    *   *How did students respond to Te Puea as a female leader?*
    *   *Did the exit tickets reveal genuine interest in learning more about her challenges?*
    *   *Were Waikato/Tainui students able to share their connections to this history?*

**Teacher Preparation Note:** Consider showing photographs of Tūrangawaewae marae (if appropriate and with permission) to make Te Puea's achievement tangible for students. If possible, arrange a field trip to Tūrangawaewae for later in the unit.

**Historical Context:** Te Puea lived through the aftermath of the New Zealand Wars, the land confiscations (raupatu), and the 1918 influenza pandemic. Understanding these contexts is crucial for appreciating the scale of her achievement. This lesson sets the stage for exploring these challenges in Lessons 2.2-2.4.

**Cultural Consultation:** If teaching this unit, consult with Tainui kaumātua or your school's cultural advisor to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness, especially regarding the Kīngitanga.
