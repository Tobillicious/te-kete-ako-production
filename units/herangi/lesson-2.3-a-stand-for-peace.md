### 5. Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)

| **Time** | **Activity** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW** | "Would you risk arrest to stand up for your beliefs? Why or why not?" |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching** | Introduce WALT/SC. Context: WWI 1914-1918, NZ sent troops. 1916: Conscription introduced. Te Puea's position: King Tāwhiao said Waikato would not fight again. After raupatu (Lesson 2.2), why should Māori fight for the Crown? |
| **15-40 min** | **Guided Practice** | Read handout. Groups analyze: What was Te Puea's argument? How did government respond? What were consequences? Compare to other conscription resisters. |
| **40-60 min** | **Independent Practice** | Write: "Was Te Puea's stand justified? How did it show Whaimana and Whaiara?" Use WAGOLL example. |
| **60-75 min** | **Plenary** | Discuss: "When is civil disobedience justified?" Exit ticket: "What would YOU have done in Te Puea's position?" |

### 8. Kaiako Notes

*   **Cultural:** Te Puea risked imprisonment. Emphasize her courage and principle. Connect to King Tāwhiao's prophecy.
*   **Sensitivity:** Some students may have whānau who served in WWI. Honor all choices while respecting Te Puea's position.
*   **Connection:** This resistance led directly to her work building Tūrangawaewae (Lesson 2.4) as an independent base.
