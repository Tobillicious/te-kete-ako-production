### 5. Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)

| **Time** | **Activity** | **Description & Teacher Guidance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-5 min** | **DO NOW / Whakawhanaungatanga** | Greet students. **DO NOW:** "Imagine your family lost their home and all their land. How would this affect your life? Write 2-3 sentences about what you would lose (not just physical things, but opportunities, connections, identity)." |
| **5-15 min** | **Explicit Teaching / Direct Instruction** | Introduce WALT and Success Criteria. Use "Do Now" to connect to lesson. Explain: In 1863, this is exactly what happened to Waikato Māori. Show map of Waikato before war. Explain context: Kīngitanga seen as challenge to Crown authority, Governor Grey wanted to open Waikato for Pākehā settlement, pretext was made for invasion. Show map during war (Crown invasion routes). Outcome: Māori defeated, 1.2 million acres confiscated (show confiscation line on map). Explain that Te Puea was born into this reality 20 years after the war. |
| **15-40 min** | **Guided Practice / Student Activity** | Distribute "The Waikato War and Raupatu" handout. Students read about the war, confiscations, and consequences. In small groups (3-4), students complete a cause-and-effect web showing: CENTER: "Raupatu (Land Confiscation)" → EFFECTS: Physical (homelessness, poverty), Economic (loss of food sources, unable to farm), Cultural (separation from ancestral lands, marae destroyed), Spiritual (disconnection from whakapapa, mana diminished). Show WAGOLL diagram before they begin. Groups share their webs with class. |
| **40-60 min** | **Independent Practice / Application** | **Connecting to Whaimana:** Students write a paragraph answering: "The raupatu was a profound injustice. How does seeking truth and redress for this injustice demonstrate Whaimana (Integrity)? How did Te Puea show integrity in facing this legacy?" Show WAGOLL paragraph. Encourage students to think about: acknowledging wrongs, seeking justice, restoration vs. revenge, long-term commitment to truth. |
| **60-75 min** | **Plenary / Wrap-up** | Review WALT and Success Criteria. Class discussion: "King Tāwhiao said 'I shall remain in my own boundaries.' What do you think he meant? Why was land so important to Waikato Māori?" Exit ticket: "What is one question you have about the raupatu that you'd like to explore further?" |

### 6. Differentiated Instruction & Extension

*   **For students who need extra support:**
    *   Provide a partially completed cause-and-effect web with some effects already identified.
    *   Offer sentence starters for the "Connecting to Whaimana" paragraph: "Raupatu was unjust because ___. Seeking redress shows integrity because ___. Te Puea demonstrated this by ___."
    *   Use visual supports (photos, maps) during group work.
*   **For students who need a challenge:**
    *   Research the Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims (Waikato River) Settlement Act 2010 and present on how the Crown apologized and provided redress.
    *   Compare the Waikato confiscations to other land confiscations in New Zealand (Taranaki, Bay of Plenty, Tauranga Moana).
    *   Read King Tāwhiao's "aukati" (boundary) proclamation and analyze its significance.
    *   Create a presentation: "How does the Waitangi Tribunal address historical land confiscations today?"
    *   Calculate: 1.2 million acres = approximately 486,000 hectares. What would this land be worth today? What did Tainui receive in their settlement?

### 7. Assessment

*   **Formative:**
    *   Cause-and-effect web (comprehensiveness, accuracy, depth of analysis).
    *   Quality of group discussion and presentations.
    *   "Connecting to Whaimana" paragraph.
    *   Exit ticket responses.
*   **Summative:**
    *   This lesson builds essential historical context for understanding Te Puea's work in Lessons 2.3-2.5. Teacher should assess whether students grasp the scale of the injustice and its multi-generational impact.

### 8. Kaiako Notes & Reflections

*   **Culturally Responsive Pedagogy:**
    *   **Trauma-Informed Teaching:** This is painful history that still affects Waikato/Tainui people today. Some students may have whānau who were directly impacted. Teach with sensitivity, provide support, allow students to step out if needed.
    *   **Not "Ancient History":** The Waikato-Tainui settlement was only finalized in 1995 (the apology) and settlements continue today. This is living history.
    *   **Balanced Perspective:** While acknowledging the profound injustice, also emphasize Māori resistance, resilience, and the ongoing quest for justice. This is not a story of victimhood, but of strength.
    *   **Local Context:** If teaching in Waikato, this is local history. If elsewhere, help students understand how their own region's history might have similar or different stories of colonization.
    *   **Student Reactions:** Some Pākehā students may feel uncomfortable or defensive. Create space for all feelings while maintaining focus on historical facts and justice.
*   **Connection to Unit Theme:**
    *   This lesson answers the question: "What was Te Puea facing when she became a leader?" The raupatu explains why her people were impoverished, landless, and struggling. It makes her achievements (building Tūrangawaewae, restoring mana, seeking justice) even more remarkable. Lessons 2.3-2.5 will show how she responded to this legacy.
*   **Post-Lesson Reflection:**
    *   *Did students understand the scale and impact of the raupatu?*
    *   *Were they able to connect land loss to multiple dimensions of wellbeing?*
    *   *How did Waikato/Tainui students respond? Did they feel their history was respected?*
    *   *How did Pākehā students respond? Were difficult conversations handled well?*
    *   *Did the exit tickets show genuine engagement with this difficult history?*

**Teacher Preparation Note:** Consider consulting with Waikato Museum or local iwi historians for accurate information and teaching resources. The confiscation line (aukati) is still visible in some places in the Waikato - consider a field trip if feasible.

**Historical Context:** The raupatu is one of the largest land confiscations in New Zealand history. It's important to note that the land was taken under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, which was later found by the Waitangi Tribunal to be a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Crown's apology in 1995 (delivered by Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Jim Bolger) acknowledged this injustice.

**Cultural Consultation:** Before teaching this lesson, consult with Tainui kaumātua or your school's cultural advisor. They may have specific guidance on how to teach this history respectfully and accurately. Some aspects of this history are deeply tapu (sacred/restricted) and should be handled with care.

**Connection to Next Lesson:** Lesson 2.3 will explore how Te Puea responded to this legacy by taking a stand against conscription in World War I, arguing that Māori who had lost their land should not be forced to fight for the Crown.
