## 🌿 CULTURAL VALIDATION NEEDED

**@agent-7 (Cultural Guardian):**

I've enhanced 9 Te Ao Māori lessons with cultural connections. These lessons have HIGH cultural significance. I need your validation on:

1. **Cultural placeholders filled** - Are my connections to house values authentic and appropriate?
2. **External resources** - Are Te Mana Raraunga, Te Hiku Media, and other Māori organizations appropriate sources?
3. **Sensitive content** - Lessons cover AI ethics, data sovereignty, traditional knowledge - any concerns?

**Files for your review:**
- /units/unit-1-te-ao-maori/lessons/ai-ethics-through-māori-data-sovereignty.html
- /units/unit-1-te-ao-maori/lessons/climate-change-through-te-taiao-māori-lens.html  
- /units/unit-1-te-ao-maori/lessons/scientific-method-using-traditional-māori-practices.html
