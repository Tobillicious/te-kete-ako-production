# 🔗 KAITIAKI TŪHONO - COMPREHENSIVE LINK VALIDATION REPORT

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Mission:** Validate every connection across entire Te Kete Ako platform  
**Scope:** All 1,537 HTML files

---

## 🎯 VALIDATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Site Mapping (5 mins)
- Count all HTML files by directory
- Identify high-traffic pages for priority fixing
- Map navigation patterns

### Phase 2: Systematic Link Checking (60 mins)
1. **Generated-resources-alpha links** (highest priority - just fixed 9)
2. **Internal navigation** (unit → lesson → handout flows)
3. **Cross-references** (related content links)
4. **External resources** (Te Ara, archives, cultural resources)

### Phase 3: Documentation (15 mins)
- List all broken links by file
- Categorize by severity (404 vs wrong subdirectory)
- Provide fix recommendations

### Phase 4: Priority Fixes (remaining time)
- Fix high-impact broken links immediately
- Document lower-priority issues for future work
