## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS:**

### **What Worked Well:**
1. ✅ Homepage is clear and welcoming
2. ✅ Search returns relevant results
3. ✅ Mathematics hub is comprehensive
4. ✅ Lessons.html filters work perfectly (NEW!)
5. ✅ Print functionality is seamless
6. ✅ Cultural integration visible but not intimidating

### **What Could Be Better:**
1. 🟡 Search could be more prominent (bigger search bar?)
2. 🟡 "Year 8 fractions" specifically might not exist (topic coverage gap)
3. 🟡 Could add "Quick Find" suggestions ("Looking for Y8 Math? Click here!")
4. 🟡 Onboarding tour is helpful but might be skipped
5. 🟡 Direct "Year 8 Math" button on homepage might be faster

### **Critical Discovery:**
**GraphRAG-powered lessons.html = GAME CHANGER!**
- Before: User might never find lesson (static 100)
- After: User can filter by year + subject instantly!

---
