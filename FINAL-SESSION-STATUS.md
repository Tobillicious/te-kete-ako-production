## 📝 REMAINING WORK (Optional Enhancements)

### Handouts Without Sidebars (~42 files)
These handouts use `main-container` but have NO sidebar currently:

**Example files:**
- primary-source-analysis-1975-memorial-of-right.html
- ai-ethics-and-bias.html
- treaty-of-waitangi-handout.html
- writers-toolkit-*.html (multiple)
- *-comprehension-handout.html (multiple)

**Why they don't have sidebars:**
- Either A4 print worksheets (intentionally no sidebar)
- OR content pages that haven't been updated yet

**Recommendation:**  
Add sidebars methodically - check each file type, avoid duplicates, test thoroughly. This is 2-3 more hours of work but not critical for core functionality.
