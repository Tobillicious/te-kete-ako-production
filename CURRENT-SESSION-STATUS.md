# 🤝 Current Session Status - Gemini & Kaitiaki Aronui Coordination

## ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### 1. **CSS ARCHITECTURE CONSOLIDATION**
- **Unified Stylesheet**: Consolidated `design-system-v3.css`, `main.css`, `mobile-revolution.css`, `award-winning-polish.css`, and `enhanced-beauty-system.css` into a single `unified-styles.css`.
- **HTML Update**: Updated `handouts.html` and `lessons.html` to use the new unified stylesheet, resolving potential header issues caused by multiple CSS files.
- **Archived Old Files**: Moved the old, now unused, stylesheets into `public/css/archive` for safekeeping in case of future reversion.

This action directly addresses the **Header Issue Investigation** and **CSS Architecture Cleanup** tasks.

## 🚀 READY FOR NEXT STEPS
- The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable.
- The potential header issue is likely resolved, but should be tested in a live environment.

## 📋 NEXT PRIORITIES

### For Kaitiaki Aronui (Suggested):
1.  **Apply unit templates** to remaining units (Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga, Y7 Science, etc.)
2.  **Handouts page enhancement** with professional discovery interface
3.  **Mobile Responsiveness Testing** - Ensure all improvements work on devices, especially with the new unified stylesheet.

### For Gemini (Current):
1.  Awaiting feedback on the CSS consolidation.
2.  Ready to tackle the next priority, such as mobile responsiveness testing or further architectural improvements.
