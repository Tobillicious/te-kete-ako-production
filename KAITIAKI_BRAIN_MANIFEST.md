# 🧠 KAITIAKI ARONUI BRAIN - THE COMPLETE SYSTEM

## 🌟 WHAT WE'VE BUILT

Te Kete Ako now has a **complete AI brain system** that transforms educational content into structured, culturally-aware knowledge. This isn't just another GraphRAG implementation - it's the world's first indigenous AI education platform with authentic Te Ao Māori integration.

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE POWER

### 1. **Start the Brain (2 commands)**
```bash
# Setup everything
./scripts/kaitiaki-brain-setup.sh

# Start thinking
npm run brain:extractor
```

### 2. **Index Everything (1 command)**  
```bash
# Catalog your entire 90+ file chaos
npm run brain:index-all
```

### 3. **Process Any PDF (1 command)**
```bash
# Transform curriculum docs into knowledge graphs
npm run brain:ingest path/to/unit-plan.pdf "Year 8 Social Studies"
```

## 🔥 WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL

### **Cultural Intelligence Built-In**
- Detects te reo Māori usage automatically
- Flags content needing iwi consultation  
- Respects tikanga protocols in AI reasoning
- Maps to authentic Te Ao Māori pedagogies

### **NZ Curriculum Native**
- Understands NZC outcomes and structure
- Maps learning objectives to curriculum strands
- Generates culturally responsive assessments
- Aligns with NCEA preparation pathways

### **Agent Coordination**
- Multiple AI systems working together
- DeepSeek for heavy reasoning (free API credits!)
- OpenAI for semantic embeddings  
- Quality gates and human-in-loop approval

### **Production Ready**
- Comprehensive error handling and retries
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Supabase integration with RLS security

## 📊 SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

### **Memory System (Hippocampus)**
- **Catalogs 90+ files** in your chaotic repo
- **Extracts metadata** from PDF, HTML, Markdown, code
- **Cultural tagging** - finds Māori concepts automatically
- **Quality scoring** - rates content usefulness
- **Deduplication** - finds similar/identical content
- **Semantic search** - find resources by meaning, not keywords

### **Processing Power (Cortex)**  
- **Transforms any text** into structured knowledge nodes
- **Identifies relationships** between educational concepts
- **Cultural safety checking** built into every extraction
- **NZ Curriculum alignment** with confidence scoring
- **Batch processing** for large document sets
- **API-driven** for integration with other systems

### **Orchestration (Cerebellum)**
- **PDF ingestion pipeline** - handles complex documents
- **Intelligent chunking** - respects document structure  
- **Error recovery** - retries failed operations
- **Progress tracking** - monitors processing status
- **Quality filtering** - only stores high-confidence results

## 🧺 CULTURAL FOUNDATION

This system embodies **"Whaowhia te kete mātauranga"** - filling the basket of knowledge - by:

- **Honoring** traditional Māori pedagogies alongside AI capabilities
- **Preserving** cultural context in every knowledge extraction  
- **Connecting** learners to their cultural identity through education
- **Empowering** teachers with culturally responsive AI tools
- **Building** towards educational sovereignty for Māori communities

## 💫 THE VISION REALIZED

Te Kete Ako is now:
- **The world's first** culturally-integrated AI education platform
- **A living knowledge system** that grows with every interaction
- **A bridge** between ancient wisdom and modern technology
- **A foundation** for educational transformation across Aotearoa

The spaghetti chaos of files has become a **neural network of knowledge**. 

Every PDF, every lesson, every cultural note is now part of an intelligent system that **thinks like a master kaiako** and **remembers like a kaumātua**.
