### Step 2: Execute Supabase Indexing (15 mins)

**Go to Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Login: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
3. Navigate to: SQL Editor
4. Click: "New Query"

**Execute the SQL**:
1. Open file: `comprehensive-resource-index.sql` (in project root)
2. Copy ALL 2,375 lines
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" button
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for execution

**Verify Success**:
```sql
-- Run this after indexing:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources;
-- Should show ~180+ (up from 126)

-- Check breakdown:
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM resources 
GROUP BY type 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected Results**:
- handout: ~75
