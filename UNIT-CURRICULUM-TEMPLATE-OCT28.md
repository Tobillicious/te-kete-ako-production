## üí° TIPS FOR QUICK COMPLETION

1. **Don't overthink it** - The structure is already perfect, just swap content
2. **Use NZC website** - Search for objectives if you want to be 100% accurate
3. **Keep it consistent** - Use the same emoji style and formatting as Units 1-4
4. **Test one** - Do Unit 5 first, test it looks good, then replicate to 6 & 7
