# üîç MISSING LESSONS ANALYSIS - October 28, 2025

## üìä SUMMARY

**Total Expected Lessons:** 42  
**Lessons Found:** 32  
**Lessons Missing:** 10

---

## üìã MISSING LESSONS BREAKDOWN

### Unit 5: Globalization & Identity
**Expected:** 5 lessons  
**Found:** 4 lessons (Lessons 1-4)  
**Missing:** 1 lesson

**‚ùå Missing:**
- `unit-5-lesson-5.html` - **Lesson 5** title unknown

**Context:** Unit 5 covers Globalization, Media Literacy, Digital Citizenship, and Cultural Identity. All 4 existing lessons are complete and functional. Lesson 5 may have been intentionally omitted OR planned but not yet created.

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY WITH USER** - Check if Lesson 5 was intentionally cut or needs to be created.

---

### Unit 7: Digital Tech & AI Ethics
**Expected:** 5 lessons (standard unit structure)  
**Found:** 3 lessons (Lessons 1-3)  
**Missing:** 2 lessons

**‚ùå Missing:**
- `unit-7-lesson-4.html` - **Lesson 4** title unknown
- `unit-7-lesson-5.html` - **Lesson 5** title unknown

**Context:** Unit 7 covers AI Fundamentals, Algorithmic Bias, and MƒÅori Data Sovereignty (lessons 1-3). Lessons 4-5 may have been planned to cover additional digital tech/AI topics but were never created OR intentionally limited to 3 lessons.

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY WITH USER** - This is a critical unit given the AI focus. Check if lessons 4-5 were intentionally omitted or need creation.

---

### Y8 Systems Unit
**Expected:** ~10 lessons (2 lessons per module √ó 5 modules)  
**Found:** 3 lessons  
**Missing:** ~7 lessons

**‚úÖ Found:**
- `systems-lesson-1-1.html` - Module 1, Lesson 1: What is a System?
- `systems-lesson-2-1.html` - Module 2, Lesson 1: Government Systems
- `systems-lesson-5-1.html` - Module 5, Lesson 1: Rights & Participation

**‚ùå Missing (if full module structure intended):**
- `systems-lesson-1-2.html` - Module 1, Lesson 2
- `systems-lesson-2-2.html` - Module 2, Lesson 2
- `systems-lesson-3-1.html` - Module 3, Lesson 1
- `systems-lesson-3-2.html` - Module 3, Lesson 2
- `systems-lesson-4-1.html` - Module 4, Lesson 1
- `systems-lesson-4-2.html` - Module 4, Lesson 2
- `systems-lesson-5-2.html` - Module 5, Lesson 2

**Context:** The Y8 Systems unit appears to be incomplete OR was designed as a sampler with only 1-2 lessons per module rather than complete modules. The existing 3 lessons are spread across 3 different modules (1, 2, and 5), suggesting they may be standalone "intro" lessons rather than full multi-lesson modules.

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY WITH USER** - Was this intended as:
- Option A: Sample/starter lessons (keep as is)
- Option B: Full multi-lesson modules (need 7+ more lessons)

## ‚úÖ UNITS WITH COMPLETE LESSON SETS

1. **Unit 1: Te Ao MƒÅori Foundations** (5/5 lessons) ‚úÖ
2. **Unit 2: Decolonized History** (5/5 lessons) ‚úÖ
3. **Unit 3: STEM & MƒÅtauranga** (5/5 lessons) ‚úÖ
4. **Unit 4: Economic Justice** (5/5 lessons) ‚úÖ  
5. **Unit 6: Hauora & Wellbeing** (5/5 lessons) ‚úÖ

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Ask User:**
   - "Is Unit 5 Lesson 5 needed or was it cut?"
   - "Are Unit 7 Lessons 4-5 needed?"
   - "Is Y8 Systems meant to be 3 sample lessons or full modules?"

2. **Update GraphRAG:**
   - Document which units are complete (1-4, 6)
   - Document which have intentional gaps vs. incomplete work

### If Lessons Need Creation (Medium Priority)
**Only proceed if user confirms lessons are needed:**

1. **Unit 5 Lesson 5** (1 lesson)
   - Use lesson-template-PERFECT.html
   - Topic TBD based on unit theme
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

2. **Unit 7 Lessons 4-5** (2 lessons)
   - Use lesson-template-PERFECT.html
   - Topics TBD (possibly: AI in Education, Future of AI, etc.)
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours

3. **Y8 Systems Lessons** (7 lessons IF full structure wanted)
   - Use lesson-template-PERFECT.html
   - Complete all 5 modules with 2 lessons each
   - Estimated time: 14-21 hours

**Total if all needed:** 10 lessons, 20-30 hours work

## üí° NOTES

**Pattern Observed:**
- Units 1-4 and 6 all have exactly 5 lessons (standard structure)
- Unit 5 has 4 lessons (possibly cut short or lesson 5 pending)
- Unit 7 has 3 lessons (possibly intentional or incomplete)
- Y8 Systems has 3 lessons across different modules (sampler or incomplete?)

**Most Likely Scenario:**
- Unit 5 Lesson 5: Intentionally cut OR pending creation
- Unit 7 Lessons 4-5: Intentionally limited to 3 lessons OR incomplete
- Y8 Systems: Designed as sample lessons, not full modules

**Least Disruptive Option:**
- Document current state as "intentional" in GraphRAG
- Create missing lessons ONLY if user explicitly requests them
- Focus on fixing existing content first (34 handouts with bugs)

---

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**Immediate Action:** Mark Task 8 complete - analysis done  
**Next Action:** Get user confirmation on whether missing lessons are needed  
**Alternative:** Skip lesson creation entirely, focus on fixing 34 handouts

**GraphRAG Update Needed:**
- Add note: "Units 1-4, 6 complete (5 lessons each)"
- Add note: "Unit 5 has 4 lessons (lesson 5 TBD or cut)"
- Add note: "Unit 7 has 3 lessons (lessons 4-5 TBD or cut)"
- Add note: "Y8 Systems has 3 sample lessons (incomplete or by design)"
