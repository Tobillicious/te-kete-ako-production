# üß† GRAPHRAG STATUS & NEXT STEPS

**Updated**: August 5, 2025 5:50 PM  
**Current Status**: 309 resources (up from 179) ‚úÖ  
**Coverage**: Significantly improved but still incomplete  

---

## üìä **CURRENT GRAPHRAG STATE**

### **Resources Scanned:**
- **309 educational resources** properly catalogued
- **94 handouts** with metadata and cultural levels
- **16 lessons** from guided inquiry and Y8 systems
- **8 interactive games** including Te Reo variants
- **YouTube Educational Library** with 1000+ hours of content
- **Cultural Safety Validation Framework** for content curation
- **AI-powered features** now documented
- **Navigation connections** mapped

### **Relationship Network:**
- **90,635 relationships** between resources
- **Subject-based connections** (same curriculum area)
- **Year-level correlations** (learning progression)
- **Cultural integration levels** (high/medium/low)

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS FOR 10PM AGENT**

### **1. IMMEDIATE GRAPHRAG EXPANSION**

The cb1d615 commit contains **303 HTML files** that aren't all in the GraphRAG yet:

```bash
# Check discrepancy
find public -name "*.html" | wc -l  # Should be 400+
grep -c '"id":' te_kete_knowledge_graph.json  # Currently 309

# Run expansion scan
node scripts/resource-recovery.js --deep-scan --include-units --include-experiences
```

### **2. MISSING CONTENT CATEGORIES**

Based on directory analysis, likely missing from GraphRAG:
- **Units 1-7 lessons** (`public/units/lessons/` - 50+ files)
- **Experience modules** (`public/experiences/` directory)
- **YouTube Library System** (`public/youtube-library.html`, admin interface)
- **Curriculum alignment pages** (multiple curriculum-*.html files)
- **Assessment frameworks** (decolonized-assessment-framework.html etc.)
- **Cultural Safety Validation** system and tools

### **3. ENHANCED METADATA EXTRACTION**

Current GraphRAG captures basic metadata. Enhance with:
- **Learning objectives** from lesson content
- **Assessment criteria** from rubrics
- **Cultural context depth** analysis
- **YouTube video metadata** (duration, subjects, cultural safety ratings)
- **AI integration points** (which pages use DeepSeek/EXA.ai)
- **Prerequisites and pathways** between resources
- **Video-lesson alignment** mappings

### **4. RELATIONSHIP SOPHISTICATION**

Current relationships are basic (same subject, same year level). Add:
- **Learning progression** relationships (prerequisite ‚Üí advanced)
- **Cultural thematic** connections (similar MƒÅori concepts)
- **Assessment alignment** (lessons ‚Üí handouts ‚Üí assessments)
- **YouTube-lesson** connections (videos supporting lesson content)
- **Cultural validation** relationships (content authenticity verification)
- **AI enhancement** connections (resources enhanced by EXA.ai)

## üõ†Ô∏è **GRAPHRAG ENHANCEMENT COMMANDS**

### **Deep Content Analysis:**
```bash
# Enhanced metadata extraction
python scripts/extract_knowledge_graph.py --include-objectives --include-assessments

# Cultural content analysis  
python scripts/implement_content_enrichment.py --cultural-depth --maori-concepts

# AI integration mapping
grep -r "deepseek\|exa-search\|graphrag" public/ --include="*.html" | python scripts/map_ai_integrations.py
```

### **Relationship Enhancement:**
```bash
# Learning pathway analysis
python scripts/analyze_learning_pathways.py --year-progression --cultural-threads

# Cross-curricular connections
python scripts/cross_subject_analysis.py --te-ao-maori-integration
```

---

## üìã **VERIFICATION STRATEGY**

### **Completeness Check:**
1. **File count alignment**: `find public -name "*.html" | wc -l` should match GraphRAG resources
2. **Directory coverage**: All major directories represented in GraphRAG
3. **Navigation mapping**: All linked resources should be in GraphRAG

### **Quality Validation:**
1. **Cultural accuracy**: Te Reo MƒÅori terms correctly identified
2. **Learning level appropriateness**: Year levels accurately assigned
3. **Subject alignment**: NZ Curriculum areas properly mapped

### **Relationship Validation:**
1. **No orphaned resources**: Every resource connected to at least 3 others
2. **Progression pathways**: Clear learning sequences identifiable
3. **Cultural threads**: MƒÅori concepts properly interconnected

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Immediate Goals:**
- [ ] **400+ resources** in GraphRAG (from current 309)
- [ ] **All major directories** represented
- [ ] **No missing navigation** connections

### **Enhanced Goals:**
- [ ] **Learning pathway** relationships mapped
- [ ] **Cultural concept** networks established  
- [ ] **AI integration** points documented
- [ ] **Assessment alignment** connections created

### **Advanced Goals:**

## üß† **DEEPSEEK INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES**

Use our DeepSeek functions to enhance GraphRAG:

```bash
# Content analysis with cultural context
curl -X POST "/.netlify/functions/deepseek-agent" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "message": "Analyze this educational resource for MƒÅori cultural integration depth and learning objectives",
  "content": "...",
  "useGraphRAG": true
}'
```

### **AI-Enhanced Metadata:**
- **Cultural authenticity** scoring
- **Learning objective** extraction
- **Prerequisites** identification
- **Extension activity** suggestions

---

## üöÄ **FINAL GRAPHRAG VISION**

The completed GraphRAG should enable:

### **For Teachers:**
- **Instant resource discovery** based on learning objectives
- **Cultural integration** recommendations for any topic
- **Assessment alignment** verification
- **Learning pathway** customization

### **For Students:**
- **Personalized learning** paths based on progress
- **Cultural connection** exploration
- **Prior knowledge** linking
- **Extension resource** suggestions

### **For AI Systems:**
- **Contextual recommendations** from EXA.ai searches
- **DeepSeek reasoning** about educational connections
- **Progress tracking** with intelligent next steps
- **Cultural sensitivity** validation

---

**RESULT**: Te Kete Ako becomes a **living knowledge ecosystem** where every resource is connected, discoverable, and culturally grounded! üåü
