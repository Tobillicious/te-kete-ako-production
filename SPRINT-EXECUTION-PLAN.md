# 🚀 SPRINT EXECUTION PLAN - Security + Intelligence Amplification

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Sprint Type:** Security Hardening + Intelligence Amplification  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## 🎯 **SPRINT GOALS**

### **Security Hardening (Priority 1)**
- ✅ Complete database security fixes (RLS, SECURITY DEFINER views)
- ✅ Implement proper RLS policies per business rules
- ✅ Audit all public tables for security issues
- ✅ Document security best practices

### **Intelligence Amplification (Priority 2)**
- 🔍 Identify super-hubs (100+ connections) for network effects
- 🔗 Link orphaned Q90+ resources to subject hubs
- 🌉 Build Y11→Y12→Y13 prerequisite bridges
- 📈 Scale underutilized relationship types (30 types @ 1 use → 100+ uses)

---

## 📋 **EXECUTION CHECKLIST**

### **Phase 1: Security Hardening (30 min)**

#### **Step 1: Execute Security Fixes**
```bash
# Set environment variable and run security fixes
export SUPABASE_KEY="your-key-here"
python3 execute-security-fixes.py
```

#### **Step 2: Verify Security Status**
- Check views have `security_invoker=true`
- Verify RLS enabled on all public tables
- Confirm RLS policies created
- Test application functionality

#### **Step 3: Customize RLS Policies**
- Review permissive policies created
- Implement user-specific access controls
- Add role-based restrictions where needed

### **Phase 2: GraphRAG Intelligence Gathering (45 min)**

#### **Step 1: Super-Hubs Discovery**
```sql
-- Find resources with 100+ connections (network effect multipliers)
SELECT r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.quality_score, COUNT(rel.id) AS connections
FROM graphrag_resources r
JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON r.file_path = rel.source_path OR r.file_path = rel.target_path
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.quality_score
HAVING COUNT(rel.id) >= 100
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### **Step 2: Orphaned Gems Identification**
```sql
-- Find Q90+ resources with <5 connections (low-hanging fruit)
SELECT r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.year_level, r.quality_score, COALESCE(COUNT(rel.id), 0) AS connections
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON r.file_path = rel.source_path OR r.file_path = rel.target_path
WHERE r.quality_score >= 90
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.year_level, r.quality_score
HAVING COALESCE(COUNT(rel.id), 0) < 5
ORDER BY r.quality_score DESC, connections ASC
LIMIT 50;
```

#### **Step 3: Year Bridge Analysis**
```sql
-- Identify weak year-level bridges (Y11→Y12→Y13 gaps)
SELECT source_year_level, target_year_level, COUNT(*) AS bridge_count, ROUND(AVG(confidence)::numeric, 3) AS avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE relationship_type = 'prerequisite_for'
  AND source_year_level IS NOT NULL
  AND target_year_level IS NOT NULL
  AND source_year_level <> target_year_level
GROUP BY source_year_level, target_year_level
ORDER BY bridge_count ASC;
```

#### **Step 4: Underutilized Relationship Types**
```sql
-- Find relationship types used <10 times (scale opportunities)
SELECT relationship_type, COUNT(*) AS usage_count, ROUND(AVG(confidence)::numeric, 3) AS avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
GROUP BY relationship_type
HAVING COUNT(*) < 10
ORDER BY usage_count ASC, avg_confidence DESC;
```

### **Phase 3: Intelligence Amplification Actions (60 min)**

#### **Action 1: Link Orphaned Gems to Super-Hubs**
- Target: 50 Q90+ orphans → 2 hub connections each
- Expected Impact: 100+ new high-value relationships
- Method: Subject-based matching with confidence 0.94

#### **Action 2: Build Y11→Y13 Prerequisite Bridges**
- Target: 30+ new prerequisite relationships per subject
- Expected Impact: Enable student progression through senior secondary
- Method: Quality-based matching (80+ score) with confidence 0.92

#### **Action 3: Scale Underutilized Relationship Types**
- Target: Scale 30 relationship types from 1 use → 100+ uses each
- Expected Impact: 3,000+ new high-value relationships
- Method: Pattern matching and automated relationship creation

## 🎊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Security Goals:**
- ✅ 0 security linting errors
- ✅ All public tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ Views use security_invoker (not SECURITY DEFINER)

### **Intelligence Goals:**
- 🎯 500+ new GraphRAG relationships created
- 🎯 50+ orphaned gems linked to hubs
- 🎯 30+ Y11→Y13 prerequisite bridges
- 🎯 3,000+ underutilized relationship types scaled

### **Platform Impact:**
- 📈 Improved resource discoverability
- 🌉 Better student progression pathways
- 🔗 Enhanced learning connections
- 🧠 Smarter recommendation engine
