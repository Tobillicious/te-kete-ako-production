# 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: /units/index.html is Minified!

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Problem:** The /units/index.html file is COMPLETELY MINIFIED to a single line!

---

## 📊 **THE PROBLEM:**

**File:** `/public/units/index.html`  
**Status:** **MINIFIED TO LINE 1** ❌

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head>...</head><body>...EVERYTHING ON LINE 1...</body></html>
```

---

## 🔥 **WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM:**

1. **Impossible to debug** - Can't see structure
2. **Impossible to search** - All content on 1 line
3. **Impossible to fix** - Can't find closing tags
4. **nav-container might not be properly closed!**

---

## 🎯 **HYPOTHESIS: Unclosed `<div id="nav-container">`**

**If the minified file has:**
```html
<div id="nav-container"></div><script>fetch('/components/navigation-standard.html')...
```

**But what if it's actually:**
```html
<div id="nav-container">...ALL PAGE CONTENT HERE...</div>
```

**THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE 8442PX HEADER!**

The nav-container would contain:
- The injected navigation-standard.html
- The hero section
- All unit cards
- All content
- = 8,442px of content!

---

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION:**

**Step 1:** Unminify /units/index.html to see the actual structure
**Step 2:** Check if nav-container is properly closed
**Step 3:** Fix the structure if broken
**Step 4:** Deploy and test

---

## 📋 **HOW TO UNMINIFY:**

Use an HTML formatter/beautifier to expand the file to readable format.

**Or manually check the minified line for:**
```html
<div id="nav-container"></div>
```

**vs**

```html
<div id="nav-container">
```
(with no closing tag immediately after)

**Status:** 🎯 **MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE FOUND!**  
**Action:** Unminify /units/index.html to verify!
