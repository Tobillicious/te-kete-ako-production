## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

### **1. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM PROBLEMS**
**Status:** 🔴 **URGENT**
- **Issue:** Supabase authentication failing intermittently despite API keys in codebase
- **Symptoms:** Users can't sign in/register reliably
- **Investigation Needed:** 
  - Check if environment variables are loading correctly in production
  - Verify Supabase project configuration and RLS policies
  - Test the entire auth flow end-to-end
- **Files to Check:** `js/supabase-client.js`, `js/auth-ui.js`, `.env` handling

### **2. UNDERUTILIZED CODEBASE ASSETS**
**Status:** 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Issue:** Many files in the codebase aren't being maximized
- **Examples:** 
  - `experiences/` directory has amazing content not well-integrated
  - `y8-systems/` lessons could be expanded across curriculum
  - Various handout templates are incomplete
- **Action Required:** Complete audit of ALL files to identify opportunities

### **3. MĀORI CONTENT AUTHENTICITY**
**Status:** 🟡 **CULTURALLY CRITICAL** 
- **Issue:** Some Māori cultural content still has placeholder text
- **Risk:** Cultural inappropriateness or inaccuracy
- **Solution Required:** Replace ALL placeholders with authentic, validated content
- **Cultural Consultation:** Consider engaging with Māori educational advisors

## 🔑 **AUTHENTICATION DEBUG GUIDE**

### **Step 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Check if these are set correctly:
echo $SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
# Should NOT be empty in production
```

### **Step 2: Supabase Configuration**
```javascript
// In js/supabase-client.js - verify these values:
const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL'
const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'
```

### **Step 3: Browser Console Testing**
```javascript
// Test in browser console:
console.log(supabase) // Should not be undefined
supabase.auth.getUser().then(console.log) // Check current user
```

### **Step 4: RLS Policies**
Check Supabase dashboard → Authentication → RLS policies are correctly configured
