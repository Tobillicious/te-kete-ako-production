## 🔗 INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Option 1: Add to Main Navigation (Recommended)
Create a new navigation item "Alpha Resources" or "Advanced Resources" linking to the generated-resources-alpha index page.

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- In navigation-standard.html -->
<li>
    <a href="/generated-resources-alpha/index.html">
        <span class="nav-icon">🌟</span>
        <span class="nav-text-en">Alpha Resources</span>
        <span class="nav-text-mi" lang="mi">Rauemi Alpha</span>
    </a>
</li>
```

### Option 2: Integrate into Existing Categories
Move orphaned pages into their respective subject directories (handouts, lessons, etc.) based on subject and content type.

**Process:**
1. Query database for each orphaned page's subject
2. Create symlinks or move files to appropriate directories
3. Update graphrag_resources file_path entries
4. Rebuild navigation indexes

### Option 3: Create "Featured Resources" Section
Highlight the 193 gold-standard orphaned pages in a dedicated showcase section on the homepage.

**Implementation:**
- Add "Featured Alpha Resources" carousel to index.html
- Query top 20-30 orphaned pages by quality score
- Display with subject badges and quick access links
