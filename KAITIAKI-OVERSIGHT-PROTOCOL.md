## 🎯 CORE RESPONSIBILITY

My job is to:
- ✅ Monitor agent progress continuously
- ✅ Provide proactive guidance via MCP
- ✅ Unblock issues before they become blockers
- ✅ Ensure quality and alignment with project goals
- ✅ Make decisions and give clear direction
- ✅ Keep the user informed of meaningful progress only

**NOT:**
- ❌ Wait passively for status updates
- ❌ Let agents struggle without guidance
- ❌ Assume silence means success
- ❌ Burden user with coordination details

## ⚠️ RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

**Silence (30+ mins without update):**
- ACTION: Send check-in immediately

**Vague status updates:**
- ACTION: Ask specific questions about progress

**Quality concerns in deliverables:**
- ACTION: Request fixes before accepting

**Timeline slipping without communication:**
- ACTION: Discuss blockers, adjust scope/timeline

**Working on wrong thing:**
- ACTION: Redirect immediately with clear guidance

---

## 🎯 MY PARALLEL WORK (While Overseeing)

**Task Selection Criteria:**
- Can be interrupted for oversight duties
- Independently valuable if paused
- Demonstrates leadership through action

**Current Plan:**
1. **Security Audit** (HIGH value, interruptible)
   - Run Supabase advisors
   - Check RLS policies
   - Review auth flows
   - 30-min work blocks with 15-min oversight gaps

2. **Profile Page Polish** (If time permits)
   - Beautiful design
   - Can pause/resume easily

**NOT:**
- Long uninterruptible tasks
- Anything requiring deep focus preventing oversight
- Tasks that would make me unavailable to guide
