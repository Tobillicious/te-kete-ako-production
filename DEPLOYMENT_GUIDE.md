---

## 🏗️ **STEP 1: SET UP SUPABASE DATABASE**

### **1A. Create Supabase Project**
```bash
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com
# 2. Create new project
# 3. Choose region (recommend: ap-southeast-2 for New Zealand)
# 4. Set strong database password
# 5. Wait for project to initialize (~2 minutes)
```

### **1B. Deploy Database Schema** ⚡
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- /agent-knowledge-hub/architecture/supabase-schema.sql
-- Into the Supabase SQL Editor and run it

-- This will create:
-- ✅ profiles table with role-based access
-- ✅ student_projects table for submissions
-- ✅ learning_sessions table for analytics
-- ✅ collaboration_records table for group work
-- ✅ teacher_analytics table for insights
-- ✅ announcements table for communication
-- ✅ Row Level Security policies
-- ✅ Performance indexes
```

### **1C. Configure Authentication**
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings:
# 1. Enable "Confirm email" = OFF (for easier testing)
# 2. Enable "Allow new users to sign up" = ON
# 3. Set Site URL = https://tekete.netlify.app (or your domain)
# 4. Add redirect URLs for development if needed
```

### **1D. Get API Keys** 🔑
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API:
# Copy these values - you'll need them for Step 2:

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVC...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVC...
```

---

## 🌐 **STEP 2: CONFIGURE NETLIFY ENVIRONMENT**

### **2A. Set Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Netlify Dashboard > Site Settings > Environment Variables:
# Add these variables:

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-from-step-1d
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-from-step-1d
SITE_URL=https://tekete.netlify.app

# Optional for production:
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **2B. Deploy Functions** 📦
```bash
# Your Netlify Functions are ready in /netlify/functions/:
# ✅ auth-register.js - User registration
# ✅ auth-login.js - User authentication
# ✅ project-submit.js - Project submissions
# ✅ get-student-projects.js - Student portfolio
# ✅ ai-companion.js - AI chat integration

# They will auto-deploy when you push to your repo!
```

---

## 🧪 **STEP 3: TEST THE COMPLETE SYSTEM**

### **3A. Test User Registration**
```bash
# 1. Go to https://tekete.netlify.app/register.html
# 2. Create a student account:
#    - Email: student@test.com
#    - Password: TestPass123
#    - Role: Student
#    - Year Level: 8
#    - Display Name: Test Student
# 3. Create a teacher account:
#    - Email: teacher@test.com  
#    - Password: TestPass123
#    - Role: Teacher
#    - Display Name: Test Teacher
```

### **3B. Test Authentication Flow**
```bash
# 1. Login as student → Should redirect to student-dashboard.html
# 2. Login as teacher → Should redirect to teacher-dashboard.html
# 3. Verify user data displays correctly in dashboards
# 4. Test logout functionality
```

### **3C. Test AI Companion** 🤖
```bash
# 1. Login as student
# 2. Go to AI Learning Companion section
# 3. Type: "I need help with my society design project"
# 4. Verify you get culturally-aware response with:
#    - Encouragement in Māori context
#    - Whakataukī with translation
#    - Practical guidance
#    - Cultural connection
```

### **3D. Test Project Submission**
```bash
# 1. Login as student
# 2. Click "Submit Project" in dashboard
# 3. Complete 4-step submission process:
#    - Project details
#    - Cultural integration
#    - File uploads (test without files first)
#    - Review and submit
# 4. Verify submission appears in "My Submissions"
```

---

## 🔍 **STEP 4: VERIFY AI AGENT INTEGRATION**

### **4A. Test Student AI Responses**
```javascript
// Test these queries in the AI companion:

"I'm struggling with mathematics" 
// → Should connect to traditional patterns/navigation

"How do I work better with my group?"
// → Should reference whakatōhia (collective decision-making)

"I don't understand this science topic"
// → Should connect to traditional ecological knowledge

"I'm feeling unmotivated to learn"
// → Should provide encouragement with whakataukī
```

### **4B. Verify Cultural Authenticity**
```bash
# Check that AI responses include:
# ✅ Proper Te Reo Māori with macrons (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū)
# ✅ Appropriate whakataukī with translations
# ✅ Cultural connections to academic topics
# ✅ Encouragement that affirms identity
# ✅ No cultural appropriation or stereotypes
```

---

## 📱 **STEP 5: MOBILE TESTING**

### **5A. Test Mobile Responsiveness**
```bash
# Test on mobile devices or browser dev tools:
# ✅ Student dashboard layout
# ✅ Teacher dashboard navigation  
# ✅ AI companion chat interface
# ✅ Project submission forms
# ✅ Authentication pages
# ✅ All buttons and interactions work
```

---

## 🎯 **STEP 6: PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION**

### **6A. Check Load Times**
```bash
# Target performance metrics:
# ✅ Page load < 3 seconds
# ✅ AI companion response < 5 seconds
# ✅ Authentication flow < 2 seconds
# ✅ Project submission < 10 seconds
# ✅ Dashboard data load < 4 seconds
```

### **6B. Test Error Handling**
```bash
# Test edge cases:
# ✅ Network disconnection during AI chat
# ✅ Invalid login credentials
# ✅ Project submission with missing fields
# ✅ Large file uploads (when implemented)
# ✅ Database connection issues
```

---

## 🛡️ **STEP 7: SECURITY VERIFICATION**

### **7A. Test Row Level Security**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, verify:
-- ✅ Students can only see their own projects
-- ✅ Teachers can only see assigned projects
-- ✅ User profiles are properly protected
-- ✅ Analytics data is role-restricted
```

### **7B. Test Authentication Security**
```bash
# Verify:
# ✅ JWT tokens expire properly
# ✅ Refresh tokens work correctly
# ✅ Invalid tokens are rejected
# ✅ Role-based dashboard access enforced
# ✅ API endpoints require authentication
```
