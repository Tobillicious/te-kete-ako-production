# Te Kete Ako - Design System Analysis

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Identify and analyze the different design systems across the site

---

## üéØ KEY FINDINGS

### Multiple Design Systems Identified

1. **Homepage Design System** (te-kete-professional.css)
   - Modern, clean design with good contrast
   - Professional card components with shadows
   - Consistent navigation and header
   - Cultural color palette well implemented

2. **Lesson Pages Design System** (older system)
   - Different typography and spacing
   - Inconsistent navigation patterns
   - Less refined visual hierarchy
   - Different color usage

3. **Unit Pages Design System** (te-kete-container/te-kete-header)
   - Yet another design approach
   - Different class naming conventions
   - Inconsistent with other systems

### Navigation Inconsistencies

1. **Homepage Navigation**
   - Uses modern navigation with icons
   - Responsive design implemented
   - Clear visual hierarchy

2. **Lesson/Unit Navigation**
   - Simpler navigation without icons
   - Different styling and behavior
   - Inconsistent back/forward navigation

### Content Structure Differences

1. **Homepage**
   - Well-structured content sections
   - Good use of cards and visual elements
   - Clear information hierarchy

2. **Lesson Pages**
   - Content-heavy with less visual separation
   - Different heading styles
   - Inconsistent use of whitespace

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Phase 1: Unify Navigation (Week 1)
1. Standardize navigation across all pages
2. Implement consistent breadcrumb system
3. Ensure responsive behavior is consistent

### Phase 2: Harmonize Design Systems (Week 2-3)
1. Identify the best elements from each system
2. Create a unified design system that incorporates:
   - The professional look of the homepage
   - The content structure of lesson pages
   - The cultural elements from unit pages
3. Gradually migrate pages to the unified system

### Phase 3: Content Structure Optimization (Week 4)
1. Improve visual hierarchy in content-heavy pages
2. Implement consistent spacing and typography
3. Add visual elements to break up long content sections

## üé® DESIGN SYSTEM UNIFICATION STRATEGY

### Keep What Works
1. Homepage card design and shadows
2. Cultural color palette
3. Professional typography
4. Responsive navigation

### Improve What Needs Work
1. Content page visual hierarchy
2. Navigation consistency
3. Whitespace usage in content sections
4. Cross-page styling consistency

### Implementation Approach
1. Start with high-traffic pages
2. Create templates for different page types
3. Implement component library for reusable elements
4. Test and refine based on user feedback

This analysis shows that we need a more nuanced approach than simply applying one design system everywhere. Instead, we should unify the best elements while respecting the different content needs across the site.
