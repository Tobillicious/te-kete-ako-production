**Blocker 2: Auth Functionality** - 6 hours

- **Can't launch** if auth doesn't work

**Blocker 3: My Kete Connection** - 8 hours
- Connect to database

**Total:** 20 hours to beta-ready

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM TONIGHT

### **What I Learned About This Project:**

1. **Backend is secretly amazing** - 70% of auth work already done
2. **Content is better than you think** - 143 quality resources
3. **Design is truly beautiful** - culturally authentic, professional
4. **GraphRAG is archive-heavy** - don't trust its metrics for production
5. **You're closer than you think** - 18 hours to beta

### **What You Taught Me:**

1. **Trust user instincts** - "pretty good but could improve" was accurate
2. **Deployment complexity is overrated** - Cloudflare setup took 20 mins
3. **DNS issues have simple solutions** - delete the blocker, add the record
4. **Planning is good, execution is better** - we built 5 pages, not just docs
5. **One agent is plenty** - 500 agents caused the CSS crisis, not GraphRAG

---

## 🧺 TONIGHT'S BIGGEST WIN

**From:** "Site not on custom domain, future auth work"  
**To:** "Site LIVE at tekete.co.nz (propagating), clear 2-week path to beta"

**That's HUGE progress.** 🎉

## 📋 TOMORROW'S EXACT FIRST STEPS

### **Wake Up → Do This:**

1. **Test tekete.co.nz** (should work by morning!)
2. **Read:** CRITICAL-ANALYSIS-OCT27-NIGHT.md (this doc)

5. **Focus:** 3 hours of auth polish
