                        <p>This lesson equips students with practical techniques to create suspense, a crucial element of engaging narrative writing. By deconstructing examples, including one from a p콞r캐kau, students will learn to control information and pacing to evoke anticipation and anxiety in their readers.</p>

                        <h3>1. Starter: What Happens Next? (5 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Play a short, suspenseful movie clip with the sound off (e.g., the 'glass of water' scene from Jurassic Park). Stop it at the most tense moment. Ask students: "What do you think happens next? What makes you feel that way?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students share predictions and identify visual cues that create tension (e.g., trembling, close-ups, darkness).</p>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>2. Introduction: The Writer's Toolbox of Suspense (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce the concept of suspense using the definition from the handout. Explain the three key techniques: Foreshadowing, Pacing, and A Sense of Danger.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students read and highlight the definitions on their handout.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>3. "I Do": Deconstructing Suspense in a P콞r캐kau (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce a suspenseful moment from a p콞r캐kau (M캐ori legend). For example, the moment before a taniwha reveals itself.</p>
                        <p class="cultural-quote">"The water in the gorge, usually so clear, turned a murky green. A single, huge bubble broke the surface, then another. Rata gripped his taiaha, his knuckles white. He could feel a deep vibration through the soles of his feet, a rhythmic thrumming that seemed to come from the very heart of the stone. The air grew cold, and the birdsong fell silent."</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Model a think-aloud analysis: "The author uses foreshadowing with the murky water and bubbles. They slow the pacing by focusing on small details: Rata's grip, the vibration, the silence. This creates a sense of danger because we know something unnatural is about to happen."</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students listen and identify the techniques as the teacher points them out.</p>

                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Direct students to the "upstairs floorboard" example on the handout. In pairs, have them identify and label all the suspense techniques they can find. Share answers as a class.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work in pairs to annotate the example, then share their findings with the class.</p>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>5. "You Do": Independent Application (20 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Instruct students to complete the "Application" task on their handout, rewriting the simple sentence into a suspenseful paragraph. Remind them to use at least two techniques.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students write their own suspenseful paragraph.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>6. Plenary: Author's Chair (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Ask for volunteers to sit in the "Author's Chair" and read their paragraph aloud. After each reading, ask the audience: "What technique did you notice? How did it make you feel as a reader?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students share their work and listen for suspense techniques in their peers' writing.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide a word bank of suspenseful words (e.g., "creaked," "shadow," "slowly," "trembled," "silent"). Give them a sentence-by-sentence scaffold (e.g., "Sentence 1: Describe the setting. Sentence 2: Hint that something is wrong...").</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to write a longer passage that builds to a climax and then ends on a cliffhanger. Ask them to write a second paragraph that resolves the tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> When using p콞r캐kau, explain that these are important cultural narratives, not just simple myths. The suspense in these stories often serves to teach a lesson or explain a natural phenomenon.</li>
