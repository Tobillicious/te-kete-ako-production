                        <p>This lesson introduces students to the ancient and powerful art of rhetoric. By understanding the three core appeals—Ethos, Pathos, and Logos—students will be able to both deconstruct the persuasive messages they see every day and apply these techniques to make their own writing more convincing and effective.</p>

                        <h3>1. Starter: What is Persuasive? (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Show students three short, different advertisements (e.g., one with a celebrity endorsement, one with a sad story, one with scientific claims). Ask: "Which one is most persuasive to you? Why? What is it doing to convince you?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students discuss the different persuasive strategies used in the ads, providing a natural lead-in to Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>2. Introduction: The Three Appeals (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce Ethos, Pathos, and Logos using the definitions and examples on the handout. Use hand gestures to help students remember: Ethos (point to head/brain for credibility), Pathos (point to heart for emotion), Logos (point outwards for logic/facts).</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students read the definitions and practice the hand gestures.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>3. "We Do": Rhetorical Appeals Detective (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Direct students to the "Rhetorical Appeals Detective" game on their handout. Have them complete the interactive activity, matching the examples to the correct appeal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work in pairs or individually to complete the game, reinforcing their understanding.</p>

                        <h3>4. "I Do": Deconstructing the Appeals (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Work through the "Deconstruction" task on the handout as a class. For each example, ask students to not only identify the appeal but to explain *why* it fits (e.g., "It's Pathos because it uses emotional words like 'helpless' and 'shivering' to make you feel sympathy.").</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students contribute to the class discussion and justify their answers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Instruct students to complete the "Application" task, writing three sentences to persuade the principal, each using a different appeal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work independently to write their three persuasive sentences.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>6. Plenary: Persuasion Showcase (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Ask for volunteers to share their three sentences. For each student, ask the class: "Which of their three sentences was the most persuasive to you? Why?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students share their work and discuss the relative effectiveness of the different appeals.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide a word bank for each appeal (e.g., Pathos: "heartbreak," "joy," "outrage"; Logos: "data," "statistics," "proof").</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to find a speech or opinion article and highlight examples of all three appeals being used by the author. Have them write a short analysis of how the author balances the three appeals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> Explain that in whaikōrero, a speaker's Ethos comes from their whakapapa and their right to speak. They use Pathos through storytelling and powerful language, and Logos by referencing historical events and tribal knowledge. All three are woven together.</li>
