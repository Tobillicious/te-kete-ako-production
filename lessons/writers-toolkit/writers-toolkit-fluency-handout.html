                <p>
                    Sentence fluency is the rhythm and flow of the language. It's the way sentences work together to create a smooth, pleasant reading experience. Writing with good fluency is easy to read aloud; the sentences seem to glide effortlessly from one to the next. Poor fluency, on the other hand, can make writing feel choppy, repetitive, and difficult to read. The key to achieving fluency is variety. By using a mix of different sentence lengths and structures, you can make your writing more mature, engaging, and powerful.
