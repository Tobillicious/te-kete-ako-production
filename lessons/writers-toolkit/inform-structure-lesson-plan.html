                        <p>This lesson teaches students that a clear structure is like a skeleton for their writing‚Äîit holds everything together.

                        <h3>1. Starter: Unscramble the Story (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Provide students with a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) that has been cut up into individual sentences and jumbled. The paragraph should have a clear chronological order (e.g., the steps for making toast). In pairs, students must reassemble the paragraph into a logical order.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work in pairs to sequence the sentences correctly. Discuss why their chosen order makes the most sense.</p>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>2. Introduction: Building a Framework (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce the three main text structures from the handout: Chronological, Compare/Contrast, and Cause/Effect. For each one, draw a simple icon on the board (e.g., a timeline for chronological, a Venn diagram for compare/contrast, a flowchart for cause/effect). Briefly explain the purpose of each.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students take notes, perhaps sketching the icons next to the definitions on their handout.</p>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>3. "I Do" & "We Do": Structure Sorting (20 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Use the "Deconstruction" examples from the handout. Read the first one aloud ("Due to a lack of rainfall..."). Ask students: "Which structure is this? What are the signal words?" Confirm it's Cause/Effect. Repeat for the second example.</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Provide a list of writing topics on the board (e.g., "My first day of school," "Cats vs. Dogs," "The effects of social media," "How to make a p≈´rini"). As a class, sort the topics under the best text structure heading.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students participate in identifying the structures and sorting the topics.</p>

                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Direct students to the "Application" task on their handout. Instruct them to choose one topic and write a short paragraph using the specified structure. Remind them to use the signal words.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work independently to write their structured paragraph.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>5. Plenary: Peer Review (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Have students share their paragraph with a partner. The partner's job is to identify the structure used and one signal word that proves it. </p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students read their partner's work and provide feedback based on the task instructions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide sentence frames for each structure (e.g., "The first thing that happened was... Then...", "One similarity is... however, a key difference is...", "Because of..., the main result was...").</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to write a paragraph that combines two structures. For example, a paragraph that compares and contrasts the causes of two different historical events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> Briefly mention that whakapapa is a powerful and complex structure. It is chronological (listing generations in order) but also relational, showing the connections between people, places, and events, similar to cause and effect.</li>
