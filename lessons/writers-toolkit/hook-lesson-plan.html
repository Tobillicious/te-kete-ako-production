                        <h3>1. Starter: Guess the Topic (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Display a series of hooks from the handout (or new ones) one at a time. For each hook, ask students: "What do you think this piece of writing will be about? What makes you say that?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students predict the topic based on the hook, which demonstrates how hooks set up reader expectations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>2. Introduction: The Five Hooks (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce the five types of hooks from the handout. For each one, provide a quick definition and read the example. Emphasise that the goal is to make the reader ask a question or feel an emotion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students read along on their handout, perhaps highlighting key words for each technique.</p>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>3. "I Do": The Whakataukƒ´ as a Hook (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce the idea of using a whakataukƒ´ (MƒÅori proverb) as a powerful type of hook that connects to a deeper cultural wisdom.</p>
                        <p class="cultural-quote">"He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata. What is the most important thing in the world? It is the people, it is the people, it is the people. This ancient question lies at the heart of our modern debate about community..."</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Model how this acts as a hook: "This hook uses a rhetorical question and a famous whakataukƒ´. It makes the reader feel that the topic is important and has deep roots. It makes me want to know what the 'modern debate' is."</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students listen and discuss how a proverb can be an effective opening.</p>

                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Direct students to the "Application" task on their handout. They must write three different hooks for an essay about the harms of social media. Encourage them to be creative and try different techniques.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work independently to write their three hooks.</p>

                        <h3>5. Plenary: Hook Showcase (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Ask for volunteers to share their *best* hook. After each one is read, the class has to vote on which of the five types it is. Discuss why it is effective.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students share their work and participate in identifying the techniques used by their peers.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide sentence frames for each type of hook (e.g., "Have you ever wondered...?", "Believe it or not,...", "Imagine a world where...").</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to find examples of the five hook types in real-world texts (news articles, advertisements, novels). Have them analyse why the author chose that specific hook for that audience and purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> Explain that whakataukƒ´ are used in formal speech (whaik≈çrero) as a way to establish a connection with the audience and ground the speech in traditional wisdom. They are powerful hooks.</li>
