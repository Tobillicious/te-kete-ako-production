                        <p>This lesson teaches students that words have power beyond their literal definitions. By understanding the difference between denotation and connotation, students can learn to select words with precision, controlling the tone and emotional impact of their writing to better suit their audience and purpose.</p>

                        <h3>1. Starter: Word Association (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Write the word "dog" on the board. Ask students to brainstorm all the words and feelings they associate with it (e.g., "pet," "friendly," "loyal," "scary," "barking"). Now, do the same for the word "wolf."</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students contribute to the brainstorm. Discuss why "wolf" has a different set of connotations, even though it's a similar animal.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>2. Introduction: Denotation vs. Connotation (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce the key terms using the definitions on the handout. Use the "house" vs. "home" example to solidify understanding. Emphasise that denotation is the "brain" meaning and connotation is the "heart" meaning.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students read the definitions and examples on their handout.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>3. "I Do": The Power of a Single Word (15 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce a powerful Te Reo Māori word with deep connotations, such as <strong>whenua</strong>. Explain its dual denotation: "land" and "placenta." Discuss the powerful connotation this creates: a deep, inseparable, life-giving connection between people and the land. It's not just a place; it's part of you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Work through the "Deconstruction" task on the handout as a class, discussing the different connotations of "mob/crowd" and "slender/scrawny."</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students participate in the discussion, explaining the different feelings the words evoke.</p>

                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Direct students to the "Application" and "Critical Thinking" tasks on their handout. They will rewrite a sentence to have positive and negative connotations, and then analyse how a politician might use diction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work independently to complete the tasks on their handout.</p>

                        <h3>5. Plenary: Connotation Showcase (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Ask for volunteers to share their positive and negative versions of the sentence "The person walked into the room." Discuss the specific word choices and the effect they had on the tone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students share their sentences and explain their word choices.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> For the application task, provide a word bank of positive and negative words for "walked" (e.g., Positive: "glided," "strolled," "bounced"; Negative: "stomped," "shuffled," "crept").</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to find a news headline and analyse its diction. How do the word choices attempt to frame the story in a particular way? Have them rewrite the headline to have a different connotation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> The concept of connotation is deeply embedded in Te Ao Māori. Words like mana, tapu, and mauri have layers of meaning that go far beyond their simple English translations. This can be a rich area for discussion.</li>
