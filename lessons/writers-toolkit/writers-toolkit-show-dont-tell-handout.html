                <p>
                    "Show, Don't Tell" is one of the most powerful rules in creative writing. Instead of simply telling the reader something is true (e.g., "The man was angry"), a good writer shows it through actions, dialogue, and sensory details, allowing the reader to experience the scene for themselves. Telling is direct and informative, but showing is immersive and entertaining. It invites the reader to become a detective, drawing their own conclusions from the evidence you provide. This technique is essential for creating a world that feels real and characters that come alive.
