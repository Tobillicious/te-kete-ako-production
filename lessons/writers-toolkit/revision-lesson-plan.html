                        <p>This crucial lesson teaches students that writing is a process of refinement, much like carving or weaving. By learning a systematic approach to revision, students move beyond fixing surface errors and learn to re-see their work, making substantial improvements to their ideas, structure, and style.</p>

                        <h3>1. Starter: Spot the Difference (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Show students the original and the revised "dog" paragraphs from the Sentence Fluency handout. Ask: "What specific changes were made between the first and second version? What is the overall effect of these changes?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students identify changes (combining sentences, stronger verbs) and discuss how they improve the writing.</p>

                        <h3>2. Introduction: The Carver's Art (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Introduce the concept of revision using the metaphor of carving (whakairo). "A carver doesn't create a masterpiece in one go. They start with a rough block of wood (the first draft). Then they shape the big ideas (revising). After that, they add the fine details (editing). Finally, they sand and polish it (proofreading)." Introduce the three steps from the handout.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students discuss the analogy and read the definitions on their handout.</p>

                        <h3>3. "I Do": Modelling the Revision Process (20 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Use the example paragraph from the handout ("i think that school..."). Model the three-step revision process live on the board.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Step 1 (Big Picture):</strong> "First, let's fix the ideas. The argument is okay, but the reasons are weak. Let's add a better reason, like scientific evidence about teenage brain chemistry." (Rewrite for ideas).</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2 (Details):</strong> "Now, let's fix the style. 'i think' is weak. Let's use stronger language. The sentences are all short, let's combine some." (Rewrite for style).</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3 (Surface):</strong> "Finally, the easy part. Let's fix the spelling ('its', 'there') and add capital letters." (Proofread).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students observe the process and suggest improvements as the teacher models.</p>

                        <h3>4. "You Do": Independent Application (25 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Instruct students to use the space on their handout to revise the paragraph themselves. They can use the teacher's model as a guide but should try to create their own improved version.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students work independently to revise the paragraph, applying the three-step process.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lesson-phase">
                        <h3>5. Plenary: Showcase the Best (10 mins)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Ask for volunteers to share their revised paragraphs. For each one, ask the class: "What is one specific change that made this version better than the original?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Action:</strong> Students share their polished work and identify effective revision choices made by their peers.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Differentiation & Teacher Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide a checklist for each of the three revision steps. Work through the example paragraph as a small group, with the teacher scribing the changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to find a piece of their own previous writing and apply the three-step revision process to one paragraph. Have them submit both the "before" and "after" versions with annotations explaining their changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> The metaphor of whakairo (carving) or raranga (weaving) is a powerful way to communicate the idea that excellence comes from a patient, multi-layered process of creation and refinement.</li>
