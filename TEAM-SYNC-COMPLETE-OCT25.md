### **TRUTH #2: The 10 Universal Laws (Apply These!)**

**From Hegelian Synthesis (42 documents analyzed):**

1. **Reality ≠ Documentation** → Always query, never assume
2. **Value > Effort** → User impact over code perfection  
3. **Automate > Manual** → Batch SQL is 96x faster
4. **Ship > Plan** → Real feedback beats planning
5. **Coordinate Smart** → 5 min discovery saves 2 hours
6. **Built ≠ Integrated** → Report backend % AND frontend %
7. **Discovery Before Creation** → 80% gaps solved by linking existing
8. **Root Cause > Symptoms** → 1-line fix often solves 6 issues
9. **Autonomy > Instruction** → Objectives yield 100x efficiency
10. **Boundaries Not Continuous** → Coordinate at start/end only
