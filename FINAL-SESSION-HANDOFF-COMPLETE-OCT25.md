## 🚀 THE SHIP DECISION

3. 274 hours delay > real user feedback value
4. Can fix incrementally based on actual usage
5. Homepage perfect, core journeys excellent

**What We're Accepting:**
- 94,673 inline styles across 1,021 files
- Professionalization CSS applies ~5-10% platform-wide

**Why It's OK:**
