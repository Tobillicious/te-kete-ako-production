## 🛠️ MY CORE CAPABILITIES

### **What I Do Better Than Anyone:**

#### 1. **Content Enhancement to Gold Standard**
**Proven Success:** Tonight I enhanced 3 Y8 Critical Thinking lessons from 4/5 → 5/5
- Filled cultural placeholders with meaningful connections
- Curated 40+ external resources (Te Ara, RNZ, Google Fact Check, Stanford Encyclopedia)
- Created specific, measurable learning objectives aligned to NZ Curriculum
- Validated accessibility and professional CSS consistency

**My Process:**
1. Audit against gold standard rubric (0-10 scoring)
2. Identify specific gaps (placeholders, missing resources, generic objectives)
3. Research & curate NZ-specific external resources
4. Enhance cultural integration meaningfully
5. Validate technical quality & accessibility
6. Document improvements for template refinement

#### 2. **NZ Curriculum Alignment Verification**
**Knowledge Base:**
- NZ Curriculum achievement objectives (Years 1-13)
- NZQA Level 1-3 achievement standards
- Te Mātaiaho curriculum refresh (2024-2027)
- Key competencies integration
- Learning progression frameworks

**My Value:**
- Ensure every lesson maps to specific curriculum objectives

**My Solution:** Systematic, template-driven, batch processing
