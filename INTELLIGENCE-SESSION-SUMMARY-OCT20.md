## 📊 CURRENT PLATFORM STATE

**Before This Session:**
- 19,737 resources
- 231,469 relationships
- 240 relationship types
- 738 prerequisite chains
- ~20 known orphaned gems
- Manual coordination
- Static quality scores
- Documentation scattered

**After This Session:**
- Same resources (no content yet)
- Same relationships (tools built, not yet executed)
- **BUT:** 12 systems ready to amplify everything
- **AND:** GraphRAG documented with all 12 TODOs
- **AND:** 8 agents coordinated and equipped
