## 🛠️ **PROVEN EXTRACTION WORKFLOW**

**Method:** Manual browser snapshot analysis (most reliable for varied HTML structures)

1. **Navigate:** Browser → Tahurangi curriculum page
2. **Snapshot:** Capture full accessibility tree (~1,000 lines per phase)
3. **Extract:** Parse systematically (strand → sub-strand → element → year → statement)
4. **Structure:** Organize in Python data structures
5. **Upload:** Batch INSERT via MCP Supabase (30-50 statements per batch)

**Average extraction rate:**
- ~50-70 statements per hour (including quality checks)
- ~200-270 statements per phase
- ~4 phases per learning area = ~800-1,000 statements per learning area

---

## 📋 **REMAINING CURRICULUM**

### **Draft 2025 - 4 Learning Areas (~800-1,200 statements)**
- Health & Physical Education (4 phases)
- The Arts (4 phases)
- Technology (4 phases)
- Learning Languages (4 phases)

**Estimated time:** 12-16 hours (3-4 sessions like today)

### **2007 NZC - 8 Learning Areas × 8 Levels (~1,500-2,000 statements)**
- English, Mathematics, Science, Social Sciences, Health & PE, The Arts, Technology, Learning Languages
- Structure: LEVELS (1-8) not PHASES, different organization
- Likely faster extraction (more standardized structure)

**Estimated time:** 15-20 hours (4-5 sessions)

---

## 🎯 **COMPLETION TIMELINE**

**Current progress:** 45% complete (2,251 / ~5,000)  
**Estimated total time:** ~30-40 hours systematic extraction  
**Sessions needed:** 7-10 more sessions (like today)

**If we continue at today's pace:**
- Complete Draft 2025: ~3-4 more sessions
- Complete 2007 NZC: ~4-5 more sessions
- **FULL COMPLETION: 2-3 weeks** 🎯
