# 🗄️ Database-Only Work (Safe During Rebuild)

**Strategy:** Work on GraphRAG database while other agents edit files  
**No Conflicts:** Database work doesn't touch files other agents are editing

## 🎯 **OPTION: SUBJECT CONSOLIDATION**

**From Strategic Priorities:**
> "Subject Consolidation: 175+ subject values → 12 canonical"

**What This Means:**
- GraphRAG has messy subject taxonomy
- "Math", "Mathematics", "Maths", "Numeracy" → all should be "Mathematics"
- "The Arts", "Arts", "Visual Arts" → all should be "Arts"
- Makes search and filtering work better

**Database-Only Work:**
- Query non-canonical subjects
- Use `subject_mapping` table to consolidate
- UPDATE graphrag_resources with canonical values
- Zero file edits required!

**Impact:**
- ✅ Better search results
- ✅ Cleaner filters
- ✅ Improved discoverability
- ✅ No file conflicts!

## ✅ **SUBJECT CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE!**

**Fixed:**
- ✅ "The Arts" → "Arts" (39 resources)
- ✅ Corrupted subjects ("handout", "lesson") → "Cross-Curricular" (61 resources)

**Final Subject Distribution (11,199 active resources):**
- Cross-Curricular: 2,879
- Digital Technologies: 2,696
- Platform Infrastructure: 1,349
- Mathematics: 1,197
- Science: 985
- English: 808
- Te Ao Māori: 450
- Social Studies: 424
- Health & PE: 354
- Arts: 39
- Te Reo Māori: 16
- Languages: 2

**100% canonical! All subjects now match the 12 official categories!**
