### Example Queries Running Live:

```javascript
// Query 1: Cross-Subject Connections
SELECT r1.title, r1.subject, r2.title, r2.subject, rel.confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN graphrag_resources r1 ON rel.source_path = r1.file_path
JOIN graphrag_resources r2 ON rel.target_path = r2.file_path
WHERE rel.relationship_type = 'shared_cultural_element'
  AND rel.confidence >= 0.85
ORDER BY rel.confidence DESC
LIMIT 12
```

```javascript
// Query 2: Learning Pathways
SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE relationship_type = 'prerequisite'
  AND confidence >= 0.85
ORDER BY confidence DESC
```

## 🎯 Real Connections Discovered

### High-Confidence Cross-Curricular Links (confidence ≥ 0.90):

| Source | Target | Type | Confidence | Concept |
|--------|--------|------|------------|---------|
| Star Navigation Coordinates (Math) | Māori Astronomy Navigation (Science) | Cultural | 0.98 | Navigation |
| Health & Wellbeing Te Whare Tapa Whā (PE) | Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga (Digital Tech) | Cultural | 0.96 | Holistic Health |
| Genetics & Whakapapa (Science) | Whakapapa & Mathematical Thinking (Math) | Cultural | 0.95 | Genealogy |
| Whakapapa Mathematics (Math) | Genetics and Whakapapa (Science) | Cultural | 0.95 | Whakapapa |
| Handout: Whakapapa & Living Genealogy (Social Studies) | Genetics & Whakapapa (Science) | Cultural | 0.94 | Whakapapa |
| Algebraic Thinking in Māori Games (Math) | Unit 1: Mathematics & Māori Games (PE) | Cultural | 0.93 | Games |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Supabase Connection:
```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_KEY = '[anon_key]';

// REST API Queries
fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/graphrag_relationships?...`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => displayConnections(data));
```

### Data Flow:
1. **User visits page** → Triggers JavaScript
2. **Query Supabase** → Fetch relationships and resources
3. **Combine data** → Join relationships with resource details
4. **Filter & sort** → Show high-confidence, cross-subject connections
5. **Render UI** → Display cards with confidence scores
