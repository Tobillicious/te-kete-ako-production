## 🎯 **CURRENT TASK: FINAL TESTING**

2. **Populate resources table** with existing content
3. **Test project submission system**
4. **Verify teacher dashboard functionality**

## 🚫 **DO NOT DO THESE (ALREADY DONE)**

- ❌ Create Supabase project
- ❌ Deploy database schema
- ❌ Set environment variables
- ❌ Update API keys
- ❌ Configure authentication URLs
- ❌ Deploy Netlify Functions

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Server is running on localhost:8000** - user can test locally
2. **Authentication should work** - all environment variables are correct
3. **Move to populating resources table** if auth works
4. **Complete final testing and launch**

## ⚠️ **USER FEEDBACK**

> "least impressed I've ever been with a Claude code session this hun. Wtf happened today? We've gotten absolutely nowhere."

**The user is frustrated because we wasted time redoing completed work instead of moving forward with final testing and launch.**

---

## 🚀 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**We're 95% complete. Just need:**
- Verify auth works end-to-end
- Populate resources table
- Test project submission
- LAUNCH the world's first culturally-grounded AI educational platform

**This should take 30 minutes, not hours of redoing completed work.**
