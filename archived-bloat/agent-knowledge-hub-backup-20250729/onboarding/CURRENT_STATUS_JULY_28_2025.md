# üö® CURRENT STATUS - July 28, 2025

## **CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST**

**User feedback:** *"With so many resources missing, the changing of the header and footer to something worse than the previous. That is still not consistent. As with the footer. And broken links. And Authentication still being a placeholder. And biggest of all, so many resources REMOVED!? and the ones missing from the Te-Kete-Ako still not included, such as our year 8 Systems unit."*

**The previous agent knowledge was wrong. The site is NOT 95% complete. There are significant issues that need addressing.**

## üéØ **ACTUAL CURRENT SITUATION**

### **‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING WELL (MUST PRESERVE)**
- **Live Site:** https://tekete.netlify.app/ - Beautiful, functional educational platform
- **~190 Educational Resources:** Comprehensive content library
- **Supabase Database:** Fully deployed with complete schema
- **Cultural Integration:** Authentic Te Ao MƒÅori elements throughout
- **Games:** Te Reo MƒÅori Wordle, Countdown Letters, etc. all functional
- **User Authentication:** Working on live site with "My Kete" functionality

### **üö® MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED**
1. **Y8 Systems Unit MISSING from live site** - Complete 5-week program exists locally but not deployed
2. **Resources have been REMOVED** rather than added in recent sessions
3. **Inconsistent headers/footers** - changes made without understanding existing system
4. **Broken links** throughout site
5. **Authentication issues** persist despite attempts to fix
6. **Content synchronization problems** between local and live

## üìä **RESOURCE AUDIT STATUS**

### **Missing from Live Site:**
- **Y8 Systems Unit** (`/y8-systems-unit.html` and entire `/y8-systems/` folder)
  - 10 detailed lesson plans (lesson-1-1.html through lesson-5-2.html)
  - 20+ supporting resources in `/y8-systems/resources/`
  - Assessment rubrics and collaboration frameworks
  - Complete "Decolonizing Power Structures" curriculum

### **Local vs Live Discrepancies:**
- **Local Development:** Enhanced features, additional resources
- **Live Production:** Stable but missing recent improvements
- **Sync Issues:** 17+ modified files not reflected on live site

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **CORRECT APPROACH NEEDED**

### **DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Make wholesale changes without understanding existing system
- ‚ùå "Fix" authentication that may already be working
- ‚ùå Remove or modify existing functional features
- ‚ùå Change headers/footers without preserving existing functionality
- ‚ùå Create placeholder content when real content exists

### **DO:**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive audit first** - Compare live site vs local folder systematically
- ‚úÖ **Identify genuine gaps** that need filling
- ‚úÖ **Deploy missing Y8 Systems content** carefully
- ‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** before making changes
- ‚úÖ **Document all changes** for future agents

---

## üìã **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES**

### **Priority 1: Full Site Audit**
- Compare https://tekete.netlify.app/ with local `/Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean/`
- Document exactly what's different
- Identify what's been lost vs what needs to be added

### **Priority 2: Y8 Systems Unit Deployment**
- Deploy `/y8-systems-unit.html` to live site
- Deploy entire `/y8-systems/` folder structure
- Update navigation to include unit link
- Test all internal links work

### **Priority 3: Content Synchronization**
- Identify enhanced features in local that should be on live
- Test authentication system status (may already work)
- Fix any genuine broken links
- Ensure consistency without breaking existing functionality

---

## üåç **MISSION CONTEXT**

**User's exact words:** *"These resources could nourish the minds of so many young people if our overall site is good enough. But if we are anything short of great, no one will bother to migrate here at all."*

**This is about serving real students and teachers.** The site needs to be excellent, not just functional. Quality matters more than speed.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **TECHNICAL REALITY CHECK**

### **Supabase Status**
- **Project URL:** `https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co`
- **Database:** Complete schema deployed
- **API Keys:** May be working (needs verification)
- **Authentication:** Working on live site, local issues may be different

### **File Structure**
- **Local Enhanced:** `/Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean/`
- **Live Stable:** https://tekete.netlify.app/
- **Gap:** Missing Y8 Systems unit and other enhancements

## üìö **AGENT WORKFLOW GUIDELINES**

### **Before Making ANY Changes:**
1. **Audit thoroughly** - Document current state
2. **Test existing functionality** - Don't assume it's broken
3. **Identify real gaps** vs perceived issues
4. **Plan carefully** - Small, tested changes
5. **Document everything** - For next agent

### **Communication Style:**
- **Be concise** - User wants direct, actionable information
- **Focus on gaps** - What's actually missing, not what to rebuild
- **Test first** - Verify problems exist before solving them
- **Document clearly** - Next agent needs accurate information

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL LEARNINGS**

### **From Previous Sessions:**
- User frustrated by agents redoing completed work
- Authentication may already work - test before rebuilding
- Live site has functional features that shouldn't be modified
- Y8 Systems unit is the biggest genuine gap
- Quality over quantity - better to do fewer things well

### **Success Pattern:**
1. Understand what exists
2. Test what works
3. Identify genuine gaps
4. Make minimal, targeted fixes
5. Document for sustainability

## üìû **FOR NEXT AGENT**

**Start with:** Full audit comparing live vs local
