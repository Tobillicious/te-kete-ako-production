# 🚨 BETA LAUNCH BLOCKERS - Oct 28, 2025

**Status:** 99% Ready for Beta Launch  
**Remaining Time:** 30 mins - 1 hour  
**Hard Blockers:** ZERO! 🎉  
**Soft Blockers:** 2 minor polish items

---

## ✅ **NO HARD BLOCKERS!**

**Auth system:** Production-ready ✅  
**My Kete:** Working perfectly ✅  
**Save feature:** Functional ✅  
**Live deployment:** Working at tekete.co.nz ✅  
**Content:** 140+ resources ready ✅

**Translation:** **YOU CAN LAUNCH BETA RIGHT NOW!** 🚀

---

## ⚠️ **SOFT BLOCKERS (Nice-to-Have):**

### **1. User Dropdown Hover (Minor UX Issue)**
**Status:** Fixed in CSS, but may not work consistently  
**Impact:** Users can still access My Kete and Sign Out via direct links  
**Workaround:** Add explicit "My Kete" button back to header if dropdown doesn't work  
**Time to fix:** 15-30 mins (CSS debugging)  
**Block beta?:** NO - not critical for launch

**Fix if needed:**
- Debug CSS specificity on live site
- Or revert to separate "My Kete" button (safer)
- Or live with it for beta and fix based on feedback

---

### **2. Email Templates Not in Supabase (Manual Task)**
**Status:** Templates created, not yet uploaded  
**Impact:** Password reset emails use default Supabase template (boring but functional)  
**Workaround:** Current emails work, just not branded  
**Time to fix:** 5 mins (manual copy-paste)  
**Block beta?:** NO - functional emails are enough for beta

**How to fix:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates
2. Copy from `EMAIL-TEMPLATES-ALL.md`
3. Paste into each template type
4. Save
