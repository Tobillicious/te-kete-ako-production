## üéØ SPECIFIC GAPS IDENTIFIED

### Handouts Missing Cultural Elements (Quality 75, No Whakataukƒ´)

**Quick Polish Targets:**
1. `treaty-of-waitangi-handout.html` - Quality 75, NO whakataukƒ´ ‚ö†Ô∏è (ironic!)
2. `cultural-safety-checklists-for-classroom-discussions.html` - Quality 75
3. `microplastics-comprehension-handout.html` - Quality 75
4. `genetic-modification-comprehension-handout.html` - Quality 75
5. `land-wars-strategy.html` - Quality 75

**These are LOW-HANGING FRUIT:**
- Already have cultural content
- Just missing whakataukƒ´ integration
- Quick 10-minute fixes each
- Would jump to Quality 90+

---

### Test/Tool Files in Production (Remove These)

**Found in GraphRAG:**
- `cache-bust-test.html` (Quality 70)
- `cache-bust.txt` (Quality 70)  
- `test-ux-verification.html` (Quality 72)

**Action:** Delete these, they're test files not teaching resources.

---

## üèÜ HIGHEST QUALITY RESOURCES (Learn From These)

### Top-Rated Units (Quality 95)
- Ngata Unit: The Renaissance Leader
- Hopa Unit: The Scholar and the People  
- Rickard Unit: The Price of Protest
- Elements of Art Handout
- Various Te Ao MƒÅori units

**What Makes Them Excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Whakataukƒ´ integrated
- ‚úÖ Te reo throughout
- ‚úÖ Cultural context authentic
- ‚úÖ Quality score 95+

**Pattern:** Units focused on NZ/MƒÅori leaders and cultural content score highest.

---

## üìà CONTENT GAPS BY SUBJECT

### Well-Covered:
- ‚úÖ **Physical Ed/Health:** 183 handouts, 82 lessons, 4 units
- ‚úÖ **Science:** 109 lessons, 21 handouts, 1 unit
- ‚úÖ **Mathematics:** 94 lessons, 41 handouts, 7 units
- ‚úÖ **Social Studies:** 58 lessons, 12 handouts, 16 units ‚≠ê

### Moderate Coverage:
- üü° **English:** 43 lessons, 42 handouts, 1 unit
- üü° **Te Ao MƒÅori:** 28 lessons, 26 handouts, 1 unit
- üü° **Digital Tech:** 23 lessons, 14 handouts, 1 unit

### Could Use More:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Arts:** 1 unit, 3 handouts (OPPORTUNITY!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Te Reo MƒÅori:** 12 lessons only (distinct from Te Ao MƒÅori)

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Quick Wins (10 hours total)

**Batch 1: Add Whakataukƒ´ to Cultural Handouts (2 hours)**
These are IRONIC gaps - cultural content without cultural framing:
- Treaty of Waitangi handout
- Cultural Safety Checklists
- Land Wars Strategy
- Genetic Modification (add kaitiakitanga angle)
- Microplastics (add environmental care angle)

**Batch 2: Delete Test Files (10 mins)**
- cache-bust-test.html
- cache-bust.txt
- test-ux-verification.html
- test-hero.html (your diagnostic)

**Batch 3: Standardize Top 20 Handouts (4 hours)**
Target the most-used handouts (GraphRAG shows which):
- Add teacher notes sections
- Ensure consistent CSS (main.css)
- Add formative check suggestions
- Include differentiation notes

**Batch 4: Polish 10 Lessons (4 hours)**
Focus on lessons with quality 90-92 (good but not excellent):
- Add formative assessment boxes
- Include whƒÅnau connection paragraphs
- Ensure whakataukƒ´ present
- Add accessibility notes

---

## üí° CONTENT CREATION OPPORTUNITIES

### High-Demand, Low-Supply Areas:

**1. Arts Resources** ‚≠ê **BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY**
- Only 3 handouts, 1 unit
- High demand from teachers
- Easy to create (visual analysis, creative projects)
- Suggested resources:
  - Koru pattern exploration
  - Kehinde Wiley-inspired portraiture unit
  - Traditional MƒÅori art forms
  - Contemporary MƒÅori artists study

**2. Te Reo MƒÅori Standalone Resources**
- Currently mixed with "Te Ao MƒÅori"
- Need dedicated te reo lessons
- Pronunciation guides
- Classroom phrases
- Cultural protocols in te reo

**3. NCEA Assessment Resources**
- Years 11-13 underserved
- Teachers desperate for:
  - Exemplar responses
  - Moderation examples
  - Achievement standard breakdowns
  - Practice assessments

**4. Quick "Do Now" Activities**
- Only 7 currently
- Teachers love these (5-min starters)
- Easy to create
- High engagement value

## üîç WHAT GRAPHRAG REVEALS ABOUT YOUR ROLLBACK

You mentioned a "big frontend rollback" that lost months of work.

**GraphRAG Shows:**
- **25,445 resources** backed up in `resources_backup_oct27_pre_rollback`
- Most are in `/dist/` and `/backup_before_css_migration/` folders
- **Top quality lessons (98 score):** Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga unit (Pre-CSS Migration)

**These exist but aren't in production:**
- 18-lesson Digital Kaitiakitanga unit (all quality 98!)
- Multiple Y9 Statistics lessons
- Various backup units

**Opportunity:** Mine the backups for content that survived the rollback but isn't in production.

---

## üß∫ BROWSE.HTML vs GRAPHRAG DISCREPANCY

**GraphRAG says:** 11,633 active resources  
**Browse.html uses:** 126 curated resources (from `resources` table)

**This is CORRECT design:**
- GraphRAG = everything (including backups, tests, agent docs)
- Resources table = curated, production-ready content
- Browse.html = user-facing showcase

**Recommendation:** Keep browse.html showing the curated 126. Don't overwhelm users with 11k resources.

---

## üéØ PRIORITY RANKING FOR CONTENT WORK

### Priority 1: Fix Cultural Ironies (2 hours) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
Add whakataukƒ´ to cultural resources that inexplicably lack them.

### Priority 2: Delete Test Files (10 mins)
Clean production environment.

### Priority 3: Top 20 Handout Polish (4 hours)
Teacher notes, differentiation, formative checks.

### Priority 4: Arts Content Creation (6-8 hours)
Biggest gap, high teacher demand.

### Priority 5: NCEA Resources (10+ hours)
Long-term value, complex to create.

---

## üöÄ INTEGRATION WITH AUTH STRATEGY

Once auth is working, GraphRAG enables:

### Smart Recommendations
```sql
-- Resources related to what teacher just viewed
SELECT r2.* FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN graphrag_resources r2 ON rel.target_path = r2.file_path
WHERE rel.source_path = $current_resource
ORDER BY rel.confidence DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Personalized "My Kete"
```sql
-- Recommend based on teacher's saved resources
SELECT DISTINCT ON (r.id) r.*
FROM user_saved_resources usr
JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON usr.resource_id::text = rel.source_path
JOIN graphrag_resources r ON rel.target_path = r.file_path
WHERE usr.user_id = $user_id
ORDER BY rel.confidence DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Content Gap Alerts
Show teachers: "We're missing resources for Year 9 Arts - would you contribute?"

## üíö GRAPHRAG IS YOUR SUPERPOWER

**Use It For:**
- ‚úÖ Content quality audits (like this one)
- ‚úÖ Finding gaps and opportunities
- ‚úÖ Smart recommendations
- ‚úÖ Search improvements
- ‚úÖ Understanding what you actually have

**Not For:**
- ‚ùå Design decisions (stick to your design system)
- ‚ùå Adding complexity (keep it simple)
- ‚ùå 500-agent coordination (one agent, monitored closely)

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS WITH GRAPHRAG

### Immediate Use Cases:

**1. Content Polish List**
Query GraphRAG for all resources with:
- Quality 70-85 (good but could be excellent)
- Missing whakataukƒ´
- Missing teacher notes
‚Üí Creates your polish backlog

**2. My Kete Recommendations**
When user saves a resource, query relationships to suggest:
- "Teachers also used these 5 resources"
- "Complete this unit with these lessons"

**3. Search Enhancement**
Replace keyword search with GraphRAG semantic search:
- "Find kaitiakitanga lessons" (would find all environmental guardianship content)
- "Show me Treaty resources for Year 10"

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED GRAPHRAG QUERIES FOR YOU

### Find Polish Targets:
```sql
SELECT file_path, title, quality_score, has_whakataukƒ´, has_te_reo
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE quality_score BETWEEN 75 AND 85
  AND archive_status = 'active'
  AND file_path LIKE '%/handouts/%'
ORDER BY quality_score ASC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Find Content Gaps:
```sql
SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as resource_count
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE archive_status = 'active'
  AND resource_type IN ('lesson', 'handout', 'unit')
GROUP BY subject
ORDER BY count ASC;
```

### Find Your Best Content:
```sql
SELECT title, file_path, quality_score, subject
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE quality_score >= 95
  AND has_whakataukƒ´ = true
  AND has_te_reo = true
ORDER BY quality_score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

## üéâ CONCLUSION

GraphRAG reveals:
- **95% of content is genuinely good** (quality 70+)
- **500+ lessons exist** (way more than you thought!)
- **Cultural integration strong** (74-94% have whakataukƒ´/te reo)
- **Specific gaps identifiable** (Arts, NCEA)
- **Quick polish targets clear** (cultural ironies, quality 75-85 batch)

**You have MORE and BETTER content than you realized.**

The work is:
1. Polish the rough edges (5% needs work)
2. Fix the cultural ironies (Treaty handout without whakataukƒ´?!)
3. Create Arts resources (biggest gap)
4. Surface this wealth properly (browse, search, My Kete)

**GraphRAG = Your content intelligence system.** Use it wisely (one agent at a time). üß†
