# 📋 MANUAL EXTRACTION PLAN

**Reality:** Each subject has different HTML structure (rushed government planning)  
**Solution:** Manual extraction using browser tools - faster & more reliable

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED:**

1. **English** - 90 statements ✅ UPLOADED
2. **Mathematics** - 293 statements ✅ UPLOADED

**TOTAL IN DATABASE: 383 statements**

## 🎯 **PHASE 2B: BUILD UI NOW**

**Decision:** We have enough data to build the UI!

**What we have:**
- ✅ 383 curriculum statements
- ✅ 2 complete subjects (mandatory Jan 1 subjects!)
- ✅ All 4 phases for each
- ✅ Knowledge + Practices
- ✅ Verbatim from MoE

**Why build UI now:**
1. Can demonstrate working system
2. Test UX with real data
3. Add more subjects later
4. English + Math are the most important (mandatory Jan 1)

**Next steps:**
1. Build `curriculum-v3.html` with gorgeous UI
2. Build `js/curriculum-api.js` for data access
3. Test with real English + Math data
4. Come back and manually extract other subjects later

## 📝 **TODO: Remaining Subjects** (For later)

Can extract these manually one-by-one after UI is built:

### Draft 2025 (6 subjects):
- [ ] Science (Phases 1-4) - ~200-300 statements

**Total remaining:** ~2,500 statements  
**Extraction method:** Manual browser snapshot → Copy list items → Format JSON  
**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours (spread across multiple sessions)
