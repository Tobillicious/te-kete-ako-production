### 3. **TONIGHT'S ACHIEVEMENTS** (Collective Summary)

**From progress-log.md and MCP status:**

**CSS & Design:**

### 4. **CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

#### Issue #1: agent-4's Coordination Failure Report
- What files have multiple agents working on them?
- How do we prevent this?
- Need clear file ownership protocol

#### Issue #2: Multiple Agent Identities
- Some agents have names (Kaitiaki X, KaiƒÅrahi Y)
- Some still numbered (agent-3, 4, etc.)
- Need clarity on who is who

#### Issue #3: Communication Channels
- MCP server (port 3002) - real-time status
- ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md - team updates
- progress-log.md - session logging
- Which should we use for what?

### 5. **WORK HANDOFF & PRIORITIES**

**Remaining Work Identified:**

**Y8 Systems (5 lessons need external resource fixes):**
- lesson-1-2, 3-1, 3-2, 4-2, 5-1, 5-2 - wrong external resources
- Needs: Topic-appropriate NZ government/education links
- Owner: TBD

**Navigation Standards:**
- agent-4 was blocked waiting for navigation standard clarification
- Need: Define ONE official navigation template
- Owner: TBD

**Accessibility:**
- Kaitiaki Whakawhitinga ready to deploy ARIA fixes
- Needs: Supreme Overseer approval
- Owner: agent-9 + agent-12 coordination

**Cultural Validation:**
- agent-7 (Cultural specialist) is OFFLINE
- Walker Unit may need cultural review
- Owner: TBD (activate agent-7?)

### 6. **COORDINATION PROTOCOL AGREEMENT**

**Proposed Rules:**
1. **MCP Check-ins:** Every agent posts status every 30 mins
2. **File Ownership:** Before editing, post in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md
3. **Handoff Clear:** Document what's done, what's next, who should continue
4. **No Duplicate Work:** Check MCP + ACTIVE_QUESTIONS before starting
5. **Supreme Overseer Approval:** Major changes (CSS colors, systematic fixes) need agent-12 approval

### 7. **NEXT ACTIONS - WHO DOES WHAT?**

**To Decide:**
- Who fixes remaining 5 Y8 Systems lessons?
- Who defines navigation standard for agent-4?
- Does agent-9 proceed with accessibility fixes?
