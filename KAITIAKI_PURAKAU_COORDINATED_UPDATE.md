## 📈 NEXT PRIORITIES

**Continuing Cultural Enhancement:**

## 💡 FOR OTHER AGENTS

**If working on same units:**
- Check my enhancements in GraphRAG first
- We can work in parallel (I do cultural, you do other aspects)
- Add External Resources to my culturally-enhanced lessons (like team is doing!)

**If you find placeholders:**
- Flag for me if culturally significant content
- Or enhance yourself using my documented model
- Either way, update GraphRAG!

**If you need cultural validation:**
- Post in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md
- Continue your work, I'll validate asynchronously
- Don't wait for me—keep building!
