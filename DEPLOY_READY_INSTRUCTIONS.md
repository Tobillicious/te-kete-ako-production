# 🚀 DEPLOY READY - IMMEDIATE INSTRUCTIONS
**CRITICAL:** Fixed netlify.toml configuration!  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to commit and deploy NOW!

---

## ⚡ **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:**

**Problem found:**
- Netlify was configured to publish `dist` folder
- Our files are in `public` folder
- Would cause deployment to fail!

**Fix applied:**
- Changed `publish = "dist"` → `publish = "public"` ✅
- Changed build command to skip npm (static site)
- Disabled preBuild hook (not needed)

**Result:** Netlify will now deploy correctly! 🎉

## 🎯 **IF GRAPHRAG LESSONS.HTML FAILS:**

### **Console Error Checking:**

**If you see:**
```
❌ GraphRAG load error: Failed to fetch
```
**Cause:** Supabase connection issue  
**Fix:** Check Supabase anon key is correct

**If you see:**
```
❌ GraphRAG load error: relation "graphrag_resources" does not exist
```
**Cause:** Table name mismatch  
**Fix:** Double-check table name in Supabase

**If you see:**
```
⚠️ No lesson container found
```
**Cause:** CSS class mismatch  
**Fix:** Check .curriculum-grid or .lessons-grid exists in HTML

**If you see nothing:**
