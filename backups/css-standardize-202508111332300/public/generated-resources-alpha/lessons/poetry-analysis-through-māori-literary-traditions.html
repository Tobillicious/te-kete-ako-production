        <h3>Cultural Context & Safety Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>Cultural Protocols:</strong> When sharing Māori poetry, especially traditional forms, acknowledge the iwi/hapū origins where known. Treat all texts with respect as taonga.</p>
        <p><strong>Language Considerations:</strong> Provide English translations alongside te reo Māori texts. Encourage but don't force pronunciation attempts.</p>
        <p><strong>Sensitive Content:</strong> Some contemporary Māori poetry may address colonization impacts. Be prepared to discuss these themes appropriately.</p>

    <h2 class="wiley-section-title">Lesson Content</h2>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>1. Exploring Whakataukī (Māori Proverbs)</h3>
        <p>Whakataukī are traditional Māori poetic sayings that convey wisdom, cultural values, and observations about nature and human behavior.</p>
        
        <div class="interactive">
            <h4>Example Whakataukī:</h4>
            <p><strong>"Ehara tāku toa i te toa takitahi, engari he toa takitini"</strong></p>
            <p><em>My strength is not as an individual but as a collective</em></p>
            
            <h4>Analysis Questions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>What cultural value does this whakataukī express?</li>
                <li>Identify any poetic devices (metaphor, parallelism, etc.)</li>
                <li>How does the structure contribute to its meaning?</li>
                <li>Can you think of an English proverb with a similar message?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>2. Waiata Analysis</h3>
        <p>Waiata are traditional Māori songs that serve various purposes - lullabies (oriori), love songs (waiata aroha), and lamentations (waiata tangi).</p>
        
        <div class="interactive">
            <h4>Excerpt from "E Pā Tō Hau" (Traditional Waiata)</h4>
            <p><strong>E pā tō hau<br>
            He wini raro<br>
            He homai aroha</strong></p>
            <p><em>Oh the wind<br>
            Bringing the southerly<br>
            Bringing love</em></p>
            
            <h4>Analysis Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the natural imagery used</li>
                <li>Explain how the wind serves as a metaphor</li>

            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>3. Contemporary Māori Poetry</h3>
        <p>Modern Māori poets blend traditional forms with contemporary themes and styles.</p>
        
        <div class="interactive">
            <h4>Excerpt from "Ka Ao, Ka Ao, Ka Awatea" by Hone Tuwhare</h4>
            <p><strong>It is the new day<br>
            it is the new day seen<br>
            greening<br>
            at the edge of the sky</strong></p>
            
            <h4>Comparative Analysis:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>How does Tuwhare use repetition differently from traditional waiata?</li>

## Comprehensive Implementation Guide

### 1. Preparation
- **Cultural Consultation:** If possible, consult with your school's Māori community liaison or local iwi representatives about appropriate poems and protocols.
- **Resource Gathering:** Collect audio recordings of waiata, biographies of Māori poets, and prepare bilingual texts where needed.
- **Classroom Setup:** Arrange seating for group work and ensure technology is ready for audio/visual components.

### 2. Lesson Flow (Suggested 3-4 Sessions)

**Session 1: Foundations of Māori Poetry**
1. Begin with appropriate opening (karakia optional)
2. Introduce the concept of oral traditions in Māori culture
3. Explore 3-4 whakataukī in depth using the analysis framework
4. Small group work: Each group analyzes a different proverb then shares

**Session 2: Waiata and Traditional Forms**
1. Listen to recordings of traditional waiata
2. Guided analysis of structure, repetition, and imagery
3. Compare different types of waiata (aroha, tangi, oriori)
4. Research the historical contexts of specific waiata

**Session 3: Contemporary Voices**
1. Read and discuss works by 2-3 modern Māori poets
2. Identify how traditional elements appear in contemporary works
3. Comparative analysis activity (traditional vs contemporary)
4. Begin planning creative responses

**Session 4: Creation and Reflection**
1. Workshop time for original poetry writing
2. Peer feedback sessions
3. Performance or sharing of work (as appropriate)
4. Reflective writing about learning

### 3. Differentiation Strategies

**For English Language Learners:**
- Provide dual-language texts
- Use visual aids to support understanding
- Pre-teach key vocabulary
- Allow responses in first language where possible

**For Students Needing Extension:**
- Research the work of a specific Māori poet in depth
- Create annotated anthologies
- Investigate musical elements of waiata
- Explore connections to other indigenous literatures

**For Students with Learning Differences:**
- Use audio versions of all texts
- Provide structured templates for analysis
- Offer choice in response methods (oral, visual, written)
- Break tasks into smaller steps

### 4. Cultural Safety in Practice

- Always acknowledge the source of poems where known
- Never ask Māori students to be "cultural experts" unless they volunteer
- Present Māori poetry as living tradition, not just historical artifact
- Be mindful that some students may have personal connections to certain waiata
- Follow school protocols regarding karakia and other cultural practices

### 5. Assessment Implementation

**For the Analysis Essay:**
- Provide clear models of literary analysis
- Offer structured outlines if needed
- Allow students to focus on poems that resonate with them
- Consider alternative formats (e.g., recorded presentations)

**For Creative Responses:**
- Emphasize the importance of cultural respect over imitation
- Encourage students to draw on their own cultural backgrounds
- Provide options for different creative formats (visual poetry, digital, etc.)
- Include a reflective component about their creative choices

### 6. Additional Resources

**Suggested Poets and Texts:**
- Traditional: "E Pā Tō Hau", "Po Atarau" (Now is the Hour)
- Contemporary: Hone Tuwhare, Hinemoana Baker, Robert Sullivan
- Anthologies: "Puna Wai Kōrero" (Māori poetry anthology)

**Digital Resources:**
- NZ On Screen waiata collections
- Te Ara Encyclopedia entries on Māori literature
- DigitalNZ archives of Māori poetry

This comprehensive resource provides everything needed to deliver an engaging, culturally responsive poetry unit that meets NZ Curriculum objectives while honoring Māori literary traditions. The HTML format ensures easy deployment in digital learning environments.
