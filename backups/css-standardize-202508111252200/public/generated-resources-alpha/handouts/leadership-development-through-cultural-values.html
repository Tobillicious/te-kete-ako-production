    <div class="whakataukī">
        <p>"He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tāngata, he tāngata, he tāngata"<br>
        What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="wiley-section-title">Understanding Māori Leadership Principles</h2>
    
    <p>Traditional Māori leadership is based on service to the people (<span class="māori-term">manaakitanga</span>), collective responsibility (<span class="māori-term">kotahitanga</span>), and wisdom (<span class="māori-term">mātauranga</span>). These principles remain highly relevant for modern leadership.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Māori Leadership Values:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="māori-term">Manaakitanga</span> - Hospitality, kindness, and care for others</li>
        <li><span class="māori-term">Whanaungatanga</span> - Building and maintaining relationships</li>
        <li><span class="māori-term">Kaitiakitanga</span> - Guardianship and stewardship</li>
        <li><span class="māori-term">Rangatiratanga</span> - Self-determination and leadership</li>
        <li><span class="māori-term">Wairuatanga</span> - Spiritual dimension of leadership</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="interactive">
        <h3>Reflection Activity: Your Leadership Values</h3>
        <p>Rank these values from most to least important to your personal leadership style. Add any other values you consider important.</p>
        <p>Discuss with a partner: How might these values influence decision-making in a school setting?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="wiley-section-title">Case Study: Modern Māori Leaders</h2>
    
    <p>Research one of these contemporary Māori leaders and identify how they demonstrate traditional leadership values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dame Whina Cooper (Māori land rights)</li>
        <li>Sir Tipene O'Regan (Ngāi Tahu leader)</li>
        <li>Dr Lance O'Sullivan (health innovator)</li>
        <li>Waimihi Hotere (arts and education)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Group Activity: Leadership Scenario</h3>
        <p>Your school is planning a cultural festival. In small groups, discuss:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How would you apply <span class="māori-term">manaakitanga</span> in planning this event?</li>
            <li>What aspects of <span class="māori-term">kaitiakitanga</span> might be relevant?</li>
            <li>How would you ensure <span class="māori-term">kotahitanga</span> (unity) among participants?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Prepare a 2-minute presentation of your ideas to the class.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="wiley-section-title">Developing Your Leadership Practice</h2>
    
    <p>Consider these questions for personal reflection:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Who are the leaders you admire? What qualities do they demonstrate?</li>
        <li>How can you serve your community as a leader?</li>
        <li>What knowledge and skills do you need to develop further?</li>
        <li>How can you balance individual achievement with collective wellbeing?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="interactive">
        <h3>Action Plan</h3>
        <p>Identify one leadership opportunity in your school or community. Create a plan showing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your goal</li>
            <li>Which Māori leadership values you will apply</li>
            <li>Who you will work with</li>
            <li>How you will measure success</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
