## 🧺 **GraphRAG INTEGRATION (Future Phase)**

Once extraction is 100% complete:

1. Create `curriculum_statement` nodes in graphrag_resources
2. Map relationships:
   - Curriculum statement → Teaching resource
   - Curriculum statement → Unit plan
   - Curriculum statement → Lesson
   - Cross-curriculum connections
3. Enable queries like:
   - "Find all handouts aligned to Health & PE Phase 4 consent education"
   - "Show curriculum coverage for this unit"
   - "What Social Sciences statements connect to this Science topic?"

## ⏱️ **ESTIMATED TIMELINE TO 100%**

**Realistic:** 18-21 hours of meticulous manual extraction  
**Sessions:** 4-5 sessions of 4-6 hours each  
**Completion:** By Nov 2-3, 2025

**Worth it?** YES - this becomes the foundation for:
