## 🎯 **REMAINING POLISH ITEMS**

### **CATEGORY A: QUICK WINS** (30-45 min total)

#### 1. **Fix 4 Remaining Function Search Paths** ⚡ (10 min)
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: Easy

Functions still needing `SET search_path`:
- [ ] `get_orphaned_resources()`
- [ ] `complete_task()`
- [ ] `assign_task()`  
- [ ] `record_validation()`

**Why it didn't stick**: Database upgrade may have reset some functions. Need to re-apply or use migrations.

**Action**: Re-run ALTER FUNCTION commands or create migration

---

#### 2. **Remove Duplicate Indexes** 🔄 (5 min)
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Complexity**: Easy

Found 3 duplicate index pairs on `graphrag_relationships`:
- [ ] Drop `idx_relationships_source` (keep `idx_graphrag_relationships_source`)
- [ ] Drop `idx_relationships_target` (keep `idx_graphrag_relationships_target`)
- [ ] Drop `idx_relationships_type` (keep `idx_graphrag_relationships_type`)

**Impact**: Saves database space, faster write operations

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_relationships_source;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_relationships_target;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_relationships_type;
```

---

#### 3. **Enable Leaked Password Protection** ⚠️ **CRITICAL** (2 min)
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Complexity**: Easy (manual UI click)

**Steps**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Email Provider
2. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
3. Save

**Impact**: Prevents compromised passwords, critical for user security

---

#### 4. **Reduce OTP Expiry** 📧 (1 min)
**Priority**: RECOMMENDED  
**Complexity**: Easy (manual UI click)

**Steps**:
1. Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Email Provider
2. Set OTP expiry to ≤3600 seconds (1 hour)
3. Save

**Impact**: Reduces attack window for OTP codes

---

### **CATEGORY B: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION** (1-2 hours)

#### 5. **Remove 37 Unused Indexes** 🗑️ (30 min)
**Priority**: LOW  
**Complexity**: Medium (needs verification)

The linter found 37 unused indexes, but many are probably needed for future features:

**Safe to Remove** (Likely unused forever):
- [ ] `idx_content_type`, `idx_placeholder`, `idx_needs_depth` on `content_audit_results`
- [ ] `idx_deployment_agent`, `idx_deployment_batch`, `idx_deployment_status` on `bmad_deployment_queue`

**Keep for Future** (Will be used when features activate):
- ✅ `idx_profiles_user_id`, `idx_profiles_role` (auth features)
- ✅ `idx_student_progress_*` (when students use platform)
- ✅ `idx_graphrag_*` (just created, will be used soon!)

**Recommendation**: Only remove audit/deployment indexes (low risk)

---

#### 6. **Consolidate Duplicate RLS Policies** 🔗 (30 min)
**Priority**: LOW  
**Complexity**: Medium

Found 28 tables with multiple permissive policies for same action.

**Most impactful to consolidate**:
- [ ] `graphrag_relationships` (4 SELECT policies → 1)
- [ ] `graphrag_resources` (3 SELECT policies → 1)
- [ ] `agent_coordination` (3 SELECT policies → 1)
- [ ] `profiles` (2 SELECT, 2 INSERT, 2 UPDATE → 1 each)

**Impact**: Faster query execution, cleaner security model

**Note**: This is optimization, not critical. Current performance is good.

---

### **CATEGORY C: INFRASTRUCTURE** (5-10 min)

#### 7. **Move Vector Extension** 📦 (5 min)
**Priority**: LOW  
**Complexity**: Easy (requires migration)

Current: `vector` extension in `public` schema  
Recommended: Move to `extensions` schema

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;
ALTER EXTENSION vector SET SCHEMA extensions;
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET search_path TO public, extensions;
```

**Impact**: Best practices compliance, cleaner schema organization

---

### **CATEGORY D: TESTING & VALIDATION** (1-2 weeks)

#### 8. **Mobile Device Testing** 📱 (2-3 days)
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: Easy (just testing)

- [ ] Test on iPad (iOS Safari)
- [ ] Test on Chromebook (Chrome OS)
- [ ] Test on Android phone
- [ ] Test on iPhone (mobile Safari)
- [ ] Fix any mobile-specific bugs found

---

#### 9. **Beta Teacher Program** 👥 (1-2 weeks)
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: Medium (requires recruitment)

- [ ] Recruit 3-5 NZ teachers
- [ ] Provide onboarding
- [ ] 1 week of real classroom use
- [ ] Structured feedback collection
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback

---

#### 10. **Performance Audit** 📊 (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Complexity**: Easy (automated tools)

- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (aim for 90+ scores)
- [ ] Test with classroom bandwidth (slower connections)
- [ ] Verify PWA offline functionality
- [ ] Check mobile performance metrics

---

#### 11. **Accessibility Audit** ♿ (3-4 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Complexity**: Medium

- [ ] Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (no mouse)
- [ ] Color contrast verification (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Alt text on all images
- [ ] ARIA labels complete

---
