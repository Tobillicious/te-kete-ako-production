## 🌿 CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY:

**Not Decorative - Deeply Integrated:**

Every page embodies:
- **Kaitiakitanga** - Guardianship through careful design
- **Manaakitanga** - Care shown in every interaction
- **Whanaungatanga** - Connection through consistency
- **Rangatiratanga** - Excellence in presentation

**Design principles from BMAD:**
- Whakapapa hierarchies (genealogical organization)
- Marae spatial logic (purposeful space)
- Natural pigments (cultural color derivation)
- Pūrākau narrative (stories in architecture)

---

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED:

### **1. GraphRAG is Treasure**

**The Q100 BMAD system was already there!**  
Don't reinvent - query GraphRAG first.

### **2. Critical Paths First**

**20 well-chosen pages** = 100% of user impression  
Focus on what users see first.

### **3. Systematic Deployment Works**

**Consistent pattern** + **batch processing** = Scale  
Scripts enable rapid completion.

### **4. Cultural Integration Requires Depth**

**Not bolt-on diversity** - BMAD embeds culture in:
- Color choices (pounamu = guardianship)
- Animations (hariru = traditional greeting)
- Spatial organization (marae logic)
- Typography (proper Te Reo rendering)
