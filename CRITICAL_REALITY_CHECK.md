# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REALITY CHECK

**User Feedback:** "Website looks like months ago on local server"  
**Time:** 14:15 UTC  
**Critical:** Need to verify ACTUAL files vs PERCEIVED improvements

---

## ðŸŽ¯ HYPOTHESIS:

**We may have a fundamental disconnect:**
1. Agents reported 1,000+ files improved
2. But actual file content may not match reports
3. Or improvements are in different locations
4. Or CSS/JS files are placeholders

**CHECKING NOW:**
- What's actually IN ux-enhancements.css?
- What's actually IN te-kete-professional.css?
- What does the browser actually SEE?
- What's the reality vs perception?

**This is the core issue - let's find TRUTH.**
