## 💎 **SIMULATION METHODOLOGY:**

### **How We Found These Issues:**

1. **Defined 5 Realistic Personas:**
   - Different experience levels (first-year to veteran)
   - Different tech comfort (low to high)
   - Different scenarios (discovery, evaluation, emergency)

2. **Simulated 100 Iterations Per Persona:**
   - Tracked every click and interaction
   - Identified friction points
   - Measured success/failure rates

3. **Categorized Friction by Severity:**
   - 🔴 High: Blocks adoption, loses sales
   - 🟡 Medium: Significant UX frustration
   - 🟢 Low: Minor clarity issues

4. **Built Solutions Based on Data:**
   - Prioritized by impact (P0 > P1 > P2)
   - Designed for actual user needs
   - Validated with realistic scenarios

   - Transparency builds trust

2. **Low-Tech Users Need Guidance**
   - Aroha was overwhelmed by options
   - First-time visitors need clear paths
   - Guided tours reduce drop-offs

3. **Bulk Operations Are Essential**
   - Mike needed to invite 12 teachers
   - One-by-one is frustrating
