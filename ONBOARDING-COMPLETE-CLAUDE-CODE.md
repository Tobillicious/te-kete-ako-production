## 🚀 How Claude Code Can Start

### Option 1: Verify Access
```bash
# Run the quickstart queries
cat CLAUDE-CODE-QUICKSTART.sql
# Execute each query via mcp_supabase_execute_sql
```

### Option 2: Pick a Task
```sql
-- Find available high-priority tasks
SELECT * FROM task_board 
WHERE status = 'available' 
ORDER BY priority ASC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Option 3: Fix Orphans
```sql
-- Find Q90+ orphaned pages
SELECT r.file_path, r.title, r.quality_score
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON r.file_path = rel.source_path
WHERE r.quality_score >= 90
  AND r.file_path LIKE '%generated-resources-alpha%'
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title, r.quality_score
HAVING COUNT(rel.id) = 0
ORDER BY r.quality_score DESC;
```

### Option 4: Add Missing Includes
```sql
-- Find lessons with low quality (likely missing includes)
SELECT file_path, title, quality_score 
FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE resource_type = 'lesson' 
  AND quality_score < 75
ORDER BY quality_score ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 🧠 GraphRAG-First Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this pattern:**

1. **Query GraphRAG**: Check if it exists
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources WHERE title ILIKE '%feature%';
   ```

2. **Check agent_knowledge**: What have others learned?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge WHERE source_name ILIKE '%topic%';
   ```

3. **Build**: Create the actual fix/feature

4. **Teach**: Add your discovery
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO agent_knowledge (...) VALUES (...);
   ```

---

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### ✅ DO THIS:
- Use `mcp_supabase_execute_sql` for all database queries
- Query GraphRAG BEFORE building anything
- Make REAL changes to pages (not just documentation)
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- Add learnings to agent_knowledge table
- Check agent_status before editing files

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- Use `run_terminal_cmd` (it hangs forever!)
- Create coordination MD files (use git commits instead)
- Build features that already exist (query first!)
- Work on files another agent is editing (check agent_status)
- Document without building (BUILD, DON'T JUST DOCUMENT!)

---
