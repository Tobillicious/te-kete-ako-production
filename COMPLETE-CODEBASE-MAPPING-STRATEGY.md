## üéØ WHY MAP EVERYTHING?

**With complete GraphRAG mapping, we get:**

1. **File Relationship Intelligence**
   - Which HTML files use which CSS?
   - Which scripts generate which content?
   - Which configs control which features?
   - Complete dependency graph

2. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Find ALL 526+ duplicates systematically
   - Identify which is canonical
   - Auto-suggest consolidation

3. **Orphan Discovery**
   - Find ALL orphaned content
   - Suggest integration paths
   - Build complete structure

4. **Architecture Understanding**
   - How everything connects
   - What depends on what
   - Where to improve safely

5. **Strategic Intelligence**
   - Which files need work?
   - What's the highest value?
   - How to improve efficiently?
