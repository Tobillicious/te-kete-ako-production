# 🎯 NEXT STEPS - GraphRAG-Powered Content Organization

**Current Status:** Terminal broken, but GraphRAG is ready to use!  
**What We Did:** Fixed GraphRAG scripts to use actual Supabase database  
**What's Next:** Run analysis and create units from intelligent clusters

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (You Can Run These Now)

### **1. Open a Fresh Terminal**
The current terminal is stuck. Close it and open a new one.

```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean
```

### **2. Run GraphRAG Content Analysis**
```bash
python3 analyze-content-with-graphrag.py
```

**This will:**
- ✅ Scan all 1,420 local HTML files
- ✅ Query Supabase GraphRAG for metadata
- ✅ Find potential unit clusters (resources that group naturally)
- ✅ Identify 500+ orphaned lessons
- ✅ Show cultural integration breakdown
- ✅ Generate `graphrag-content-analysis.json` report

**Expected output:**
```
🏗️ Te Kete Ako Content Analysis (Using Real GraphRAG)
============================================================
🔍 Scanning local filesystem...
   Found ~1,420 HTML files locally
📊 Querying Supabase GraphRAG...
   Found XXX resources in GraphRAG

📈 Analyzing GraphRAG Coverage...
   ✅ In GraphRAG: XXX files
   ❌ Not in GraphRAG: XXX files

🎯 Potential Unit Clusters:
   Found XX potential unit clusters:

   📦 Y8-mathematics: 12 resources
      - [lesson] Algebraic Patterns
      - [lesson] Statistical Storytelling
      - [handout] Math Worksheet
      ... and 9 more

   📦 Y9-science: 8 resources
      - [lesson] Marine Ecology
      - [lesson] Climate Science
      ... and 6 more

🏝️ Orphaned Lessons (Not in Units):
   Found 500+ orphaned lessons
   ... (shows first 10)

✅ Report saved to: graphrag-content-analysis.json
```

### **3. Review the Analysis Report**
```bash
cat graphrag-content-analysis.json
```

or open it in your editor to see the full breakdown.

### **4. Query GraphRAG for Specific Info**
```bash
# See overall stats
python3 query_graphrag.py stats

# Find high cultural value content
python3 query_graphrag.py high

# Search for specific topics
python3 query_graphrag.py search "algebra"
python3 query_graphrag.py search "year 8"
python3 query_graphrag.py search "māori games"

# See all Māori concepts
python3 query_graphrag.py concepts
```

## 📋 WHAT TO DO WITH THE RESULTS

### **When You See Clusters Like:**
```
📦 Y8-mathematics: 12 resources
📦 Y9-english-literacy: 8 resources  
📦 Y7-science-ecology: 6 resources
```

**→ Create a new unit for each cluster with 6+ resources!**

### **Steps to Create Unit from Cluster:**

**Example: Y8-mathematics cluster (12 resources)**

1. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/units/mathematics/year-8/advanced-topics
   ```

2. **Create unit overview page:**
   - Copy template from existing unit (Y8 Statistics)
   - Update title, description, lessons list
   - Add cultural context

3. **Move/link lessons:**
   - Lessons are already created
   - Just link them in the unit overview
   - Add breadcrumb navigation

4. **Update main navigation:**
   - Add to navigation-standard.html
   - Under appropriate year level

5. **Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Y8 Mathematics Advanced Topics unit (12 lessons)"
   ```

## 🎯 REALISTIC GOALS

### **From Analysis Results:**

**If you find:**
- 10 clusters with 6+ resources → **10 new units!**
- 15 clusters with 3-5 resources → **Combine into 5 units**
- 500 orphaned lessons → **Organize top 100 into 10-15 units**

**Result:**
```
Current:  18 units (29% organized)
After:    35+ units (60-70% organized)
Timeline: 1-2 weeks of focused work
```

---

## 💡 SMART STRATEGY

### **Phase A: Quick Wins (This Week)**

1. **Run analyzer** ✅
2. **Create units from strong clusters** (8+ resources each)
3. **Target: 10 new units**
4. **Progress: 18 → 28 units (50% organized)**

### **Phase B: Medium Clusters (Next Week)**

1. **Combine related 3-5 resource clusters**
2. **Create 5-7 more units**
3. **Progress: 28 → 35 units (65% organized)**

### **Phase C: Orphan Cleanup (Week 3-4)**

1. **Manually review top 200 orphaned lessons**
2. **Group by theme/subject/year**
3. **Create 10-15 final units**
4. **Progress: 35 → 50 units (90%+ organized)**

## 🚀 WHY THIS WILL WORK

**GraphRAG Already Knows:**
- ✅ Which resources exist
- ✅ Their types (lesson, handout, etc.)
- ✅ Cultural integration levels
- ✅ Māori concepts used
- ✅ File paths and locations

**The Analyzer:**
- ✅ Groups resources by year + subject automatically
- ✅ Identifies natural clusters
- ✅ Shows you what's already related
- ✅ Suggests unit structures

**You Just Need To:**
- ✅ Review cluster suggestions
- ✅ Create unit overview pages
- ✅ Link existing lessons
- ✅ Update navigation

**No new content creation needed - just intelligent organization!**

---

## 📊 TRACKING PROGRESS

### **After Each Batch of Units:**

```bash
# Re-run analyzer to see progress
python3 analyze-content-with-graphrag.py

# Check orphaned count decreasing
python3 query_graphrag.py orphaned

# Update master tracker
```

### **Progress Metrics:**
```
Week 0: 18 units, 416 resources organized (29%)
Week 1: 28 units, 700 resources organized (50%)
Week 2: 35 units, 950 resources organized (67%)
Week 4: 50 units, 1,300 resources organized (92%)
```
