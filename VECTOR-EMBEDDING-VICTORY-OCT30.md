## üí° HOW IT WORKS

### The Magic of Semantic Search

**Old Way (Keyword Matching):**
```sql
WHERE statement_text LIKE '%energy%'
```
‚ùå Finds: "energy"  
‚ùå Misses: "electricity", "power", "forces", "renewable"

**New Way (Semantic Understanding):**
```python
searchCurriculum("energy and power systems")
```
‚úÖ Finds: energy, electricity, power, forces, motion, renewable, circuits, etc.  
‚úÖ Understands: **MEANING, not just keywords!**

### Example Use Cases

#### 1. Lesson Planning
```typescript
const topic = "teaching about sustainability for Year 9";
const statements = await searchCurriculum(topic, { phase: "Phase 4" });
// Returns relevant statements from Science, Social Sciences, Technology
// Auto-generates curriculum alignment for lesson plan
```

#### 2. Resource Auto-Tagging
```typescript
const resource = "Unit plan: Designing sustainable gardens";
const matches = await searchCurriculum(resource, { limit: 5 });
// Suggests: Science (ecosystems), Technology (design), 
//           Social Sciences (sustainability), etc.
```

#### 3. Cross-Curriculum Discovery
```typescript
const concept = "critical thinking and problem solving";
const statements = await searchCurriculum(concept);
// Returns statements from ALL learning areas that involve critical thinking
// Shows natural integration opportunities
```
