- **Result:** Already implemented (lines 157-159 in login.html)
- **Time:** 1 minute

### 3. **Cultural Whakatauk\u012b on Verify-Email** ✅
- **Task:** Add whakatauk\u012b for consistency with other auth pages

- **Time:** 5 minutes

### 5. **Save Button Auth Redirect** ✅
- **Task:** Test Save button redirects to login when not authenticated
- **Result:** WORKING PERFECTLY!
  - Logged out user → Click Save → Redirects to login.html
  - Return URL preserved: `?return=%2Fhandouts%2Fmedia-literacy-comprehension-handout.html`
  - After login, user returns to original resource
  - Button state resets correctly on fresh page load
- **Testing:** Full end-to-end flow verified
- **Time:** 8 minutes

### 6. **Forgot Password Supabase Integration** ✅
- **Task:** Fix forgot-password.html to use Supabase instead of Netlify functions
- **Issue Found:** Was calling `/.netlify/functions/auth-forgot-password` (501 error)
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Added Supabase CDN and client scripts
  - Replaced fetch() with `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`
  - Added loading state ("Sending..." button text)
  - Added redirect to `reset-password.html`
  - Better error handling
- **File:** forgot-password.html (lines 151-190)
- **Time:** 10 minutes

### 7. **Footer Consistency Check** ✅
- **Task:** Ensure all auth pages have consistent footer links
- **Result:** 
  - ✅ login.html: Full footer (about, contact, help, privacy, terms)
  - ✅ forgot-password.html: Full footer
  - ✅ register-onboarding.html: Minimal footer (intentional UX - keeps focus on form)
  - ✅ my-kete.html: Full footer
- **Decision:** Varied footer complexity is good UX (simpler during onboarding)
- **Time:** 5 minutes
