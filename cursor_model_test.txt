Testing if I can see which model I am...

If I'm still Claude Sonnet 4.5, the Cursor GLM configuration didn't work yet.

Possible issues:
1. Cursor might need restart after configuration change
2. The API endpoint format might need adjustment
3. Need to explicitly select the GLM model in Cursor's model dropdown
4. The API key might not be properly saved

What you can try:
1. Restart Cursor completely (quit and reopen)
2. In model dropdown, look for 'glm-4-5' or custom models
3. Check if there's an 'Override API Key' or 'Use Custom API' toggle
4. Verify the base URL is exactly: https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic

If I respond to this message and I'm still Claude, then the configuration 
hasn't taken effect yet.
