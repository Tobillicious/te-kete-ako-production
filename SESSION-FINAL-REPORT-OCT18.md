## ⏳ REMAINING TODOS (2/8)

### 1. Upload to Supabase GraphRAG
**Status:** Data 100% ready, awaiting table creation  
**Blocker:** Need to run SQL in Supabase dashboard (5 min task)  
**Files Ready:**
- `graphrag-upload.sql` (schema definition)
- `graphrag-resources-upload.json` (6,696 resources)
- `graphrag-relationships-complete.json` (566,852 relationships)

**Action Required:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- (see graphrag-upload.sql or create-graphrag-tables.py output)
```

### 2. Fix 708 'Needs Work' Files
**Status:** Pending systematic approach  
**Finding:** Most files just need:
- Navigation link updates
- CSS application (professional stylesheet)
- Cultural context additions (whakataukī, etc.)

**Approach:** Create automated script to:
1. Apply professional CSS
2. Add navigation components
3. Insert cultural context where missing
4. Batch process in groups of 50
