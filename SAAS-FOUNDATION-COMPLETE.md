## 🔗 **NAVIGATION ADDITIONS**

### ✅ User Dropdown Menu
**Location:** Header (when logged in)

**Added:**
```
👤 [Username]
  🧺 My Kete
  ⚙️ Account Settings  ← NEW!
  🚪 Sign Out
```

**File Changed:** `js/auth-ui.js` (line 139)

---

### ✅ My Kete Dashboard Button
**Location:** `my-kete.html` page

**Added:** "⚙️ Account Settings" button in kete header (line 288)

---

## 🐛 **CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**

### Bug #1: Wrong Database Query Field
**Files Affected:**
- `account-settings.html` (3 queries)
- `profile.html` (1 query)

**Problem:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
.eq('id', this.currentUser.id)
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
.eq('user_id', this.currentUser.id)
```

**Why This Matters:**
The `profiles` table uses `user_id` as the foreign key to `auth.users(id)`, not a direct `id` match. Using the wrong field would cause ALL database operations to fail.

---

### Bug #2: Missing Supabase CDN Script
**Files Affected:** All 4 new pages

**Problem:**
Pages tried to load `supabase-client.js` without first loading the Supabase library from CDN.

**Fix:**
Added before all script tags:
```html
<!-- Supabase CDN (must load FIRST) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

**Impact:** Without this, `window.supabase` would be undefined and auth would completely fail.

---

### Bug #3: Missing RLS Policies
**Problem:**
Supabase returned 406 errors because profiles table had no Row Level Security policies allowing users to read/update their own data.

**Fix Applied:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow users to read own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" 
ON profiles FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" 
ON profiles FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to insert own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" 
ON profiles FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Status:** ✅ Applied successfully via Supabase MCP

---

1. ✅ `account-settings.html` (646 lines)
2. ✅ `profile.html` (315 lines)
3. ✅ `pricing.html` (340 lines)

## 🧪 **TESTING COMPLETED**

### Manual Browser Testing:
✅ **Account Settings Page:**
- Loaded successfully while logged in
- Profile data populated correctly
- Edited display name from "Toby" → "Toby Smith"
- Clicked "Save Profile Changes"
- **Result:** Green success message "Profile updated successfully!"
- Verified save persisted in database

✅ **Navigation:**
- User dropdown shows "Account Settings" link
- My Kete page shows "Account Settings" button
- Both links navigate correctly

✅ **Auth Flow:**
- Page redirects to login if not authenticated ✅
- Shows loading state while fetching data ✅
- Displays profile once loaded ✅

---

## 🎯 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS (OK for Beta)**

### 1. Limited Profile Fields
**Current:** Only display_name and school_name editable

**Schema Has More:**
- role (teacher/student/admin)
- year_level (for students)
- subjects_taught (for teachers)
- cultural_identity (optional)
- iwi_affiliation (optional)

**Decision:** Add these fields based on user feedback during beta. Don't overwhelm users on day 1.

---

### 2. Change Email Uses `prompt()`
**Current:** Native JavaScript prompt dialog

**Better:** Modal with proper validation

**Decision:** Functional for beta, polish in post-beta iteration.

---

### 3. Subscription Section is Placeholder
**Current:** Just shows "Beta (Free)" with no action

**Needed Later:**
- Link to pricing page ✅ (pricing.html ready!)
- Stripe integration (backend ready, UI coming)
- Upgrade button (when paid plans launch)

**Decision:** Perfect for beta - clearly communicates free status.

---

### 4. Delete Account Partial
**Current:** Deletes profile, signs user out, shows message to contact support

**Why:** Deleting auth.users requires Supabase Admin API (security feature)

**Decision:** Acceptable for beta - rare edge case.

---

## 🚀 **BETA READINESS**
