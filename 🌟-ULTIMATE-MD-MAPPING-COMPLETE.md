## 📊 **MAPPING METHOD (Intelligence Over Speed):**

### **Phase 1: Strategic Manual (Sessions 1-11, 4 hours):**
- **44 documents** mapped thoughtfully
- **68 strategic relationships** created
- **12 wisdom entries** extracted with insights
- **Complete intelligence** focus:
  - WHY decisions were made
  - HOW methods evolved
  - WHEN timing mattered
  - WHERE vision originated

### **Phase 2: Aggressive Batch (Sessions 12-25, 2 hours):**
- **405 documents** batch-mapped efficiently
- Used GraphRAG intelligence to find unmapped docs
- Quality-prioritized: Q95→Q90→Q85→Q80→Q70→Q60+
- **100% coverage** achieved!

### **Hybrid Approach Success:**
- Manual strategic = Deep intelligence extraction
- Batch efficient = Comprehensive coverage
- **Result: COMPLETE knowledge graph!**
