## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION:

### **THE "FIRST IMPRESSIONS" SPRINT** 🚀

**Fix the registration page FIRST** because:
1. ✅ Every new user sees it
2. ✅ Currently inconsistent (says "Google search" but we have better!)
3. ✅ Component already built and tested
4. ✅ Quick win (~20 mins)
5. ✅ Sets professional tone

**THEN enhance My Kete** because:
1. ✅ Teachers need daily-use tools
2. ✅ Currently underwhelming (only 2 saves!)
3. ✅ Would make teachers LOVE the platform
4. ✅ Retention driver

**THEN polish Profile** because:
1. ✅ Teachers see it often
2. ✅ Professional identity matters
3. ✅ Currently basic
