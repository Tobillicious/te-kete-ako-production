# üìä GraphRAG Data Quality Report

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Agent:** Cursor Agent (Bug Fix & GraphRAG)  
**Scope:** 11,199 active resources in GraphRAG

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S EXCELLENT**

### **Core Metadata: 100% Complete**
- ‚úÖ **Titles:** 0 missing (100% coverage)
- ‚úÖ **Subjects:** 100% canonical (just fixed!)
- ‚úÖ **File Paths:** All valid and unique

### **Relationships: 242,695 Mapped**
Strong relationship graph with excellent coverage:

| Relationship Type | Count |
|------------------|-------|
| `same_year_level` | 64,003 |
| `same_subject` | 52,885 |
| `related_content` | 35,493 |
| `unit_contains_lesson` | 13,177 |
| `related_documentation` | 10,000 |
| `shared_cultural_element` | 5,447 |
| `prerequisite_for` | 2,342 |

**This is EXCELLENT for agent reasoning!**

## üîç **OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRICHMENT**

### **1. Missing Resource Types (77 resources)**
- Not critical - most are system files
- Could infer from file_path patterns if needed

### **2. Missing Metadata (2,116 resources)**
- **What:** JSONB metadata field is NULL
- **Impact:** Medium - agents can still reason without it
- **Solution:** Could auto-populate from HTML parsing

### **3. Semantic Tags (11,199 resources - ALL missing)**
- **What:** `semantic_tags` array is empty/NULL
- **Impact:** LOW - not currently used by agents
- **Opportunity:** Could add tags like:
  - `['interactive', 'assessment', 'project-based']`
  - `['culturally-integrated', 'te-reo-rich']`
  - `['gold-standard', 'excellence']`

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **High Priority (Do Now):**
‚úÖ **Subject consolidation** - COMPLETE!  
‚úÖ **Year level enrichment** - COMPLETE!

### **Medium Priority (Nice to Have):**
- **Option A:** Auto-populate metadata from HTML `<meta>` tags
- **Option B:** Infer missing resource_types from file paths
- **Option C:** Add semantic tags for better filtering

### **Low Priority (Future Enhancement):**
- Build semantic tag taxonomy
- Create metadata generation pipeline
- Add quality-based auto-tagging

## üìà **CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT**

**Overall:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)

**Why Excellent:**
- 100% title coverage
- 100% canonical subjects
- 242K relationships mapped
- Zero duplicate file_paths
- Strong prerequisite chains
- Cultural relationships tracked

**Minor Gaps:**
- Some metadata fields empty (non-blocking)
- Semantic tags not implemented (future feature)

---

## üí° **AGENT RECOMMENDATION**

**Status:** GraphRAG is PRODUCTION-READY ‚úÖ

**Reasoning:**
- All critical fields populated
- Relationship graph is robust
- Agents can reason effectively with current data
- Minor gaps are non-blocking
- Further enrichment would be enhancement, not fix

**Next Work:**
- Focus on FILE-BASED tasks (CSS/JS includes, etc.)
- Database is clean and well-structured
- No urgent database work remaining

---

**Summary:** GraphRAG is in excellent shape! The database work we just completed (subject consolidation + year level enrichment) was the last critical gap. Everything else is enhancement for future iterations.
