## 🌟 EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### BEFORE (Generic Placeholder):
> "This learning connects to the value of whaiora by encouraging students to [engage with content in ways that embody this value]."

### AFTER (Kaitiaki Pūrākau Authentic):
> "This learning connects to the value of whaiora by encouraging students to become guardians of the future with integrity—making principled environmental choices, standing firm in sustainable practices even when inconvenient, honestly assessing their own ecological footprint, and demonstrating courage to challenge unsustainable systems. Like rangatira who thought seven generations ahead (considering how today's decisions impact descendants), students learn that whaimana means being truthful about environmental crises, maintaining ethical commitment to sustainability, and using their voices and actions with integrity to ensure future generations inherit a thriving planet—not a depleted one."

**Transformation Elements:**
- Seven generations thinking (specific Māori concept)
- Rangatira leadership (real example)
- Environmental crisis honesty (contemporary)
- Future generations focus (educational)
- Honors cultural depth (respectful)
