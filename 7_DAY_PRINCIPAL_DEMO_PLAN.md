## 🤖 MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY:

### **Daily Stand-up (via MCP):**
**Every morning:**
1. Check ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md for priorities
2. Post your planned work
3. Work in 2-hour focused chunks
4. Post completion + evidence
5. Update GraphRAG

### **Agent Specialization:**
- **agent-4 (Kaiārahi Huarahi):** Demo flow navigation
- **Kaiārahi Hoahoa:** Visual polish
- **agent-3 (cultural):** Cultural validation
- **agent-6/12:** Content enrichment
- **agent-9:** Accessibility testing
- **Kaitiaki Aronui:** Coordination + testing

### **Communication Protocol:**
**Before starting work:**
```
Agent: [ID]
Task: [Specific, measurable]
Time: [Estimated hours]
Files: [Exact paths]
Testing: [How you'll verify]
```

**After completing:**
```
Agent: [ID]
Completed: [Exact deliverable]
Files changed: [Git status proof]
Tested: [Evidence]
Next: [What's needed]
```

---

## 🎯 SMALLER CHUNKS APPROACH:

### **2-Hour Work Blocks:**
**Example:** "Polish Y8 Systems Unit Homepage"
- Hour 1: Fix placeholders, add objectives
- Hour 2: Test links, verify mobile, commit

**Not:** "Improve entire site" (too vague)

### **Checkpoints Every 2 Hours:**
1. Git commit with clear message
2. Update ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md
3. Test what you built
4. Get feedback from team
5. Plan next 2 hours

---

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING (via GraphRAG):

### **Daily Metrics:**
```sql
-- Morning check:
SELECT COUNT(*) as demo_ready 
FROM resources 
WHERE tags @> ARRAY['demo-ready', 'principal-approved'];

-- Track progress:
INSERT INTO daily_progress (date, metric, value)
VALUES ('2025-10-16', 'demo_pages_perfect', 10);
```

### **Quality Gates:**
- ❌ No placeholders in demo path
- ✅ All links work
- ✅ Mobile tested
- ✅ Culturally validated
- ✅ Curriculum aligned

---

## 🧠 GENERATIVE EVOLUTION STRATEGY:

### **Daily Retrospective (via MCP):**
**Each evening:**
1. What worked well today?
2. What slowed us down?
3. What should we change tomorrow?
4. Update agent prompts based on learnings
5. Improve coordination protocols

### **Agent Skill Development:**
- Agents specialize in their strengths
- Learn from each other's best practices
- Share templates and patterns
- Build reusable tools
- Document learnings in GraphRAG

---

## 🎯 COHESIVE VISION:

### **The North Star:**
**"A professional, culturally-authentic educational platform that saves NZ teachers time while honoring mātauranga Māori."**

**Every decision filtered through:**
1. Does this help the Principal demo?
2. Would a teacher find this useful?
3. Is it culturally appropriate?
4. Does it work reliably?
5. Can we show this with pride?

### **Demo Story Arc:**
1. **Hook** (30 sec): "1,459 resources, Y7-13, culturally integrated"
2. **Value** (2 min): "Saves teachers hours, ready-to-print"
3. **Show** (3 min): Click through perfect unit
4. **Cultural** (1 min): "Mātauranga Māori throughout"
5. **Ask** (1 min): "Can we pilot this in your school?"
