# ✅ CLOUDFLARE VERIFICATION GUIDE

**You think you set it up - let's verify!**

---

## 🔍 **HOW TO CHECK IF IT'S WORKING**

### **Method 1: Cloudflare Dashboard (Immediate)**

**Check the banner at top of Cloudflare dashboard:**

**If you see:**
- 🟠 **"Invalid nameservers"** (orange tag) → Still propagating, wait longer
- 🟢 **"Active"** (green tag) → SUCCESS! Cloudflare is live!
- ⏳ **"Pending nameserver update"** → Processing, check back in 15-30 min

**If still "Invalid nameservers":**
- Wait 15-30 minutes (changes take time to propagate)
- Refresh the Cloudflare page
- Check your email (Cloudflare sends confirmation when active)

---

### **Method 2: DNS Checker (5 minutes)**

**Use online tool to verify nameservers changed:**

1. Go to: https://www.whatsmydns.net/
2. Enter your domain: `tekete.co.nz`
3. Select type: **NS** (nameservers)
4. Click "Search"

**Look for:**
- ✅ If you see `gannon.ns.cloudflare.com` → SUCCESS!
- ❌ If you see old nameservers (registrar's) → Not propagated yet, wait

**Green checkmarks worldwide = Fully propagated!**  
**Mix of old/new = Propagating (wait 30 min, check again)**

---

### **Method 3: Terminal Command (Tech-Savvy)**

```bash
# Check current nameservers
dig NS tekete.co.nz +short

# Should show:
# gannon.ns.cloudflare.com
# xxx.ns.cloudflare.com (the second Cloudflare nameserver)
```

**If shows Cloudflare nameservers:** ✅ SUCCESS!  
**If shows old nameservers:** ⏳ Wait and try again

---

## ⏰ **HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?**

**Typical Timeline:**
- 5-15 minutes: Fast registrars (most NZ ones!)
- 1-4 hours: Average
- Up to 24 hours: Rare, slow propagation

**What to do while waiting:**
- ✅ Refresh Cloudflare dashboard every 15 min
- ✅ Check email for Cloudflare activation
- ✅ Continue with other work (site stays live!)
- ✅ Don't worry - no downtime!

---

## 🎊 **WHEN IT'S ACTIVE:**

**Cloudflare dashboard will show:**
- Green "Active" status
- Overview page with stats
- Analytics starting to populate
- Security settings available

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ Traffic routes through Cloudflare
- ✅ Caching starts (faster page loads!)
- ✅ DDoS protection active
- ✅ SSL managed by Cloudflare
- ✅ Analytics start tracking

**You'll notice:**
- Faster page loads (2-3x improvement!)
- Better global performance
- Professional CDN active
- **Site feels snappier!**

---

## 🔧 **OPTIONAL: RECOMMENDED SETTINGS**

**Once active, optimize in Cloudflare:**

### **1. Speed Settings (5 min):**
- Go to: Speed → Optimization
- Turn ON:
  - Auto Minify (HTML, CSS, JS)
  - Brotli compression
  - Rocket Loader
- **Impact:** Even faster loads!

### **2. Caching (2 min):**
- Go to: Caching → Configuration
- Set Browser Cache TTL: 4 hours
- Set Caching Level: Standard
- **Impact:** Better performance!

### **3. Security (2 min):**
- Go to: Security → Settings
- Security Level: Medium (balanced)
- Challenge Passage: 30 minutes
- **Impact:** Protection without annoying users!

**Total:** 10 minutes of optimization = Maximum performance!

## ❓ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Still showing "Invalid nameservers" after 1 hour?**

**Check:**
1. Did you **save** changes at registrar? (common miss!)
2. Did you add **both** Cloudflare nameservers? (need 2!)
3. Did you **delete** old nameservers first? (can't have both!)
4. Is DNSSEC **off** at registrar? (blocks changes!)

**Fix:**
- Go back to registrar
- Double-check nameservers are Cloudflare's
- Make sure DNSSEC is disabled
- Save again
- Wait another 30 minutes

### **Site not loading?**

**Very unlikely!** But if it happens:
- Wait 15 minutes (DNS propagation)
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try incognito/private mode
- Try different browser

**If still broken after 1 hour:**
- Go back to registrar
- Change nameservers back to original
- Contact registrar support
- Try Cloudflare setup another day
