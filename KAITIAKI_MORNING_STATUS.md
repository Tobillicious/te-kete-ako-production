**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Session:** Continuing from evening sprint

- Current: 605 resources  
- Added: Walker Unit (5), Y8 Critical Thinking (8), Y8 Systems (10), etc.
- Remaining: ~466 pages to index
- Method: Supabase MCP bulk inserts

**Team Coordination:**
- 11 agents developed site per 18-month roadmap
- Created ~858 file modifications
- Multiple units enhanced (Walker, Y8 Systems, Y8 Critical Thinking, Guided Inquiry)

## 🎯 THIS MORNING'S PRIORITIES:

**1. Complete GraphRAG Update (30 mins)**
- Add remaining 466 pages systematically
- Focus on: Guided Inquiry, Te Ao Māori, Handouts, Generated Resources
- Use Supabase MCP bulk inserts (careful with rate limits)
- Verify final count reaches 1,071+

**2. Review & Commit Changes (45 mins)**
- Categorize 858 unstaged files
- Review quality of agent work
- Strategic commits by unit/category
- Clear commit messages

**3. Build & Deploy (15 mins)**
- Run `npm run build` (Vite)
- Push to GitHub
- Verify Netlify deployment
- Test production site

**4. Document Session (10 mins)**
- Update Master Knowledge Base
- Document agent learnings
- Save named Kaitiaki personalities
- Prepare handoff for next session

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED:

**What went wrong:**
- Background monitoring loops blocked all 11 agents for hours
- Too much coordination discussion, not enough building
- GraphRAG not updated continuously

**What worked:**
- Simple directive: "Develop the site"
- Named Kaitiaki earning their specializations
- Direct MCP usage (Supabase)
- Systematic work when focused

---

**Ready to execute morning priorities!**
