**Auditor:** AI Overseer Agent  
**Site:** http://localhost:3000 (Te Kete Ako)  
**Status:** üîç AUDIT COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Te Kete Ako is a culturally-rich educational platform with excellent content but significant technical issues that impact user experience. The site has a professional design system but suffers from extensive broken links (727 identified) and navigation inconsistencies that undermine its educational mission.

**Overall Health Score:** 65/100 (Needs Improvement)

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Broken Links Crisis (727 broken links)
- **Impact:** Severe - Users frequently encounter 404 errors
- **Scope:** Site-wide issue affecting navigation and content access
- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent URL patterns and missing redirect rules

### 2. Navigation Inconsistencies
- **Impact:** High - Users cannot reliably navigate between related content
- **Examples:** 
  - Unit lessons link to non-existent sequential lessons
  - Cross-references to handouts and resources return 404s
  - Inconsistent URL patterns (with/without .html extensions)

### 3. Visual Hierarchy Issues
- **Impact:** Medium - Content lacks clear visual separation
- **Findings:** Multiple white layers with insufficient contrast
- **User Feedback:** "Needs more contrast between all the layers of white"

## üìä DETAILED FINDINGS

### Broken Links Analysis
The broken link checker identified **727 broken links** across the site, with patterns including:

1. **Unit Navigation Issues:**
   - Sequential lesson links (e.g., lesson-1 ‚Üí lesson-2) returning 404s
   - Missing unit plan overview pages
   - Broken resource links within lessons

2. **Handout References:**
   - Links to non-existent handouts in lesson materials
   - Missing worksheet files
   - Broken cross-references to related content

3. **Inconsistent URL Patterns:**
   - Mix of URLs with and without .html extensions
   - Inconsistent path structures (e.g., /units/y8-statistics/ vs /y8-statistics/)
   - Missing redirect rules for common patterns

### Codebase Structure Analysis
The site has a well-organized structure with:

**Strengths:**
- Professional CSS design system with cultural color palette
- Comprehensive content organization (721+ resources)
- Modern web performance optimizations
- Responsive design implementation

**Areas for Improvement:**
- URL structure consistency
- Navigation component standardization
- Cross-link validation system
- Content relationship mapping

### UI/UX Contrast Issues
The current design uses multiple white/gray layers that need better differentiation:

1. **Background Layers:**
   - Primary: #ffffff (white)
   - Secondary: #f9fafb (very light gray)
   - Tertiary: #f3f4f6 (light gray)

2. **Recommendation:** Increase contrast between layers by at least 10-15% to improve visual hierarchy

## ü§ñ MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY

To address these issues effectively, I recommend implementing a coordinated multi-agent approach:

1. **Link Validation Agent:** Monitors and fixes broken links
2. **Navigation Enhancement Agent:** Standardizes navigation patterns
3. **UI/UX Optimization Agent:** Improves visual hierarchy and contrast
4. **Content Relationship Agent:** Maps and validates content connections
5. **Quality Assurance Agent:** Oversees overall site integrity

These agents would work in parallel with clear communication protocols to avoid the coordination issues identified in previous attempts.

## üìã CONCLUSION

Te Kete Ako has exceptional educational content that honors Te Ao MƒÅori, but technical issues are significantly impacting user experience. With focused effort on the identified priorities, the site can quickly transition from its current 65/100 health score to industry-leading standards.

The recommended phased approach will ensure critical issues are addressed immediately while building a robust system for long-term maintenance and enhancement.

**Next Steps:** Begin with Phase 1 critical fixes while setting up the multi-agent coordination system for parallel implementation of remaining phases.
