## 🔍 CRITICAL GAPS ANALYSIS

### **IMMEDIATE EXTRACTION PRIORITIES**

1. **2007 NZC Science** (~150 objectives)
   - Still mandatory until Te Mātaiaho Science approved
   - Critical for Years 9-13 NCEA alignment
   - Source: PDF + Tahurangi archive pages

2. **2007 NZC Technology** (~100 objectives)  
   - Note: Only 5 statements extracted from Draft 2025 (MAJOR GAP!)
   - Still mandatory for all years
   - Critical for Digital Technologies curriculum

3. **2007 NZC The Arts** (~120 objectives)
   - Still mandatory across all art forms
   - Music, Visual Arts, Drama, Dance strands

4. **2007 NZC Health & PE** (~100 objectives)
   - Still mandatory for movement and health concepts
   - Critical for wellbeing curriculum

5. **2007 NZC Social Sciences** (~100 objectives)  
   - Still mandatory for history, geography, social studies
   - Critical for citizenship education

6. **2007 NZC Learning Languages** (~80 objectives)
   - Still mandatory until 2026-2027
   - Foundational for language learning principles

### **TECHNOLOGY CRISIS**
⚠️ **CRITICAL FINDING:** Only 5 Technology statements extracted from Draft 2025!
- This suggests the Draft 2025 Technology consultation is very incomplete
- 2007 NZC Technology is still fully mandatory
- We need ~100 missing achievement objectives from 2007 NZC Technology
- This is a major curriculum coverage gap for Digital Technologies

## 🎯 EXTRACTION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Legacy 2007 NZC (URGENT)**
**Target:** ~600-750 achievement objectives  
**Priority:** HIGH (still legally mandated)  
**Sources:**
- 2007-NZC-Curriculum.pdf (scripts/curriculum-scraper/)
- Tahurangi archive sections
- TKI archived curriculum pages

**Subjects to extract:**
1. Science (Levels 1-8, 5 strands) ~150 objectives

3. The Arts (Levels 1-8, 4 strands) ~120 objectives
4. Health & PE (Levels 1-8, 4 strands) ~100 objectives
5. Social Sciences (Levels 1-8, 4 strands) ~100 objectives
6. Learning Languages (Levels 1-8, 3 strands) ~80 objectives

### **Phase 2: Consultation Monitoring**
**Target:** Future releases  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (track for completeness)  
**Action:** Monitor MoE releases for:
- German, Spanish language curricula
- Cook Islands Māori, Tokelauan
- Final versions of Te Mātaiaho drafts

### **Phase 3: Historical Archive**
**Target:** Pre-2007 curricula  
**Priority:** LOW (historical research value)

- Subject-specific 1990s curricula
- Historical curriculum development documents

## 🏗️ DATABASE SCHEMA IMPLICATIONS

### **Version Status Mapping**
```sql
-- Update curriculum_statements to track document relationships
ALTER TABLE curriculum_statements 
ADD COLUMN replaced_by TEXT,
ADD COLUMN replaces TEXT,
ADD COLUMN obsolete_date DATE,
ADD COLUMN consultation_status TEXT;

-- Examples:
-- 2007 NZC English: replaced_by='temataiaho_2025_english', obsolete_date='2025-01-01'
-- Te Mātaiaho English: replaces='2007_nzc_english'
-- Draft 2025 Science: consultation_status='draft', effective_date='2026-01-01' (expected)
```

### **Curriculum Versioning Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE curriculum_versions (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    version_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- '2007_nzc', 'temataiaho_2025', 'draft_2025'
    display_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'New Zealand Curriculum (2007)', 'Te Mātaiaho (2025)'
    status TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'mandatory', 'draft', 'consultation', 'obsolete'
    effective_date DATE,
    obsolete_date DATE,
    description TEXT,
    source_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
