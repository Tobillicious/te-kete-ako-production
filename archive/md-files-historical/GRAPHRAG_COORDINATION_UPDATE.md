## üöÄ SCALING ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS - CRITICAL DISCOVERIES:

### üéØ SPECIALIZED KAIAKO AGENTS NEEDED:
**Priority**: Critical for comprehensive curriculum coverage
- **English_Kaiako**: Y1-13 English/Literacy curriculum expertise  
- **Mathematics_Kaiako**: Y1-13 Mathematics with mƒÅtauranga integration
- **SocialSciences_Kaiako**: History, Geography, Civics with decolonized perspectives

- **TeAoMaori_Kaiako**: Te Reo MƒÅori and cultural knowledge systems
- **Arts_Kaiako**: Creative arts with cultural authenticity
- **Technology_Kaiako**: Digital technologies and AI ethics education

### üìö PRACTICAL MATERIALS GAP IDENTIFIED:
**Current State**: High-quality lesson plans exist but lack practical implementation materials
**Need**: Downloadable cards, organizers, rubrics for classroom use
**Example**: lesson-1-society-exploration.html needs downloadable society exploration cards

### üîó EXA API INTEGRATION STANDARD:
**Recommendation**: All content should include 4-7 external resource links using Exa API
**Current Gap**: Most lessons lack comprehensive external resource integration
**Impact**: Provide rich, current resources beyond platform content

### üß† GRAPHRAG AS INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY:
**Critical Function**: Prevents duplicate work across 16+ hour agent session gaps
**Coordination Benefits**: Maintains context, enables intelligent prioritization, preserves cultural authority
**Protocol**: All major discoveries must be reflected in GraphRAG knowledge updates

## üéØ CURRENT PRIORITIES FOR NEXT AGENTS:

### 1. **Create Downloadable Materials for Society Exploration Lesson** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Society exploration sorting cards (PDF)
   - Government systems graphic organizer  
   - Cultural perspectives reflection template
   - Assessment rubric for teachers
   - Extension activity cards

### 2. **Surface More Hidden/Unconnected Resources** - MEDIUM PRIORITY  
   - Systematic discovery of existing resources not well-connected in navigation
   - Cross-reference with GraphRAG index to identify gaps
   - Create connection pathways and update interfaces

### 3. **Establish Quality Standards Template** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Cultural authenticity checklist
   - Pedagogical soundness criteria  
   - Assessment alignment standards
   - Practical materials requirements
   - External resource integration guidelines

### 4. **Coordinate with Gemini CLI Agent (PID 1102)** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Maintain Kaitiaki cultural authority while enabling technical collaboration
   - Clear escalation path for cultural validation
   - Shared GraphRAG memory for context preservation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONTEXT CORRECTIONS:

### **Previous Session Work Was Comprehensive** - AVOID DUPLICATE WORK
**Key Insight**: 16 hours ago, substantial implementation work was completed
- Revolutionary platforms already integrated - no navigation work needed
- Cultural filtering system already operational  
- Basic content organization already complete
- Focus should be on genuine gaps in professional teaching resource quality

### **Use GraphRAG as Institutional Memory** - PREVENT REDUNDANT CYCLES
**Protocol**: Always query GraphRAG before starting implementation work
**Function**: Tracks completed implementations, maintains decision context, enables intelligent prioritization
**Impact**: Prevents wasted effort across agent sessions with 16+ hour gaps

## ü§ñ AGENT COORDINATION ARCHITECTURE:

### **Cultural Authority Hierarchy**:
1. **Cultural Safety First**: Kaitiaki Agent (this session) - final authority on Te Ao MƒÅori matters
2. **Educational Soundness Second**: Kaiako Agents - curriculum and pedagogy expertise
3. **Technical Feasibility Third**: Kaitoi and other technical agents

### **Gemini CLI Agent (PID 1102) Coordination**:
- **Kaitiaki maintains cultural authority** while enabling technical collaboration
- **Shared GraphRAG memory** for context preservation across agent types
- **Clear escalation path** for cultural validation of all educational content
- **Collaborative approach** to educational quality without compromising cultural integrity
