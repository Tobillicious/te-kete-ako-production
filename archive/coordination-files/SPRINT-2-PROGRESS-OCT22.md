## 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

### **4. Deploy See Also to High-Traffic Pages** 
**Status**: In Progress

**Target Pages** (20 pages):
- Science Hub
- Mathematics Hub
- English Hub
- Social Studies Hub
- Digital Technologies Hub
- Te Reo Māori Hub
- Top 10 most viewed Y7-Y9 lessons
- 4 high-quality units

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes  
**Impact**: Cross-curricular discovery visible everywhere!

---

## 📋 **REMAINING SPRINT 2 TASKS**

### **5. "Because You Viewed..." Recommendation System** 
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Concept**:
- Track user's recently viewed pages (localStorage or session)
- Use GraphRAG to recommend related resources
- Display as a persistent strip/widget
- "Because you viewed X, you might like..."

**Technical Approach**:
- JavaScript localStorage for view history
- GraphRAG relationships query from history
- Sliding banner or sidebar widget
- Privacy-first (client-side only)

---

### **6. Interactive Cross-Subject Discovery Visualizations** 
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium-High  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Concept**:
- Interactive network graph showing subject connections
- Click a subject → see connected resources in other subjects
- Visual representation of GraphRAG knowledge graph
- Beautiful D3.js or similar visualization

**Features to Include**:
- Subject nodes with size = resource count
- Edges = cross-subject relationships
- Hover = show connection details
- Click node = filter to that subject
- Color-coded by subject
- Responsive & mobile-friendly

**Possible Tools**:
- D3.js (most flexible)
- Cytoscape.js (graph-focused)
- Vis.js (simpler, good performance)

---

### **7. Smart Filtering Enhancement** 
**Status**: Pending (Search already has some filtering)  
**Priority**: Low (Basic filtering exists)  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Enhancement Ideas**:
- Add "Most Connected" filter (resources with 20+ connections)
- Add "Cross-Curricular" filter (resources with connections to 3+ subjects)
- Add year level range slider
- Add cultural integration % slider
- Save filter preferences to localStorage

## 📊 **SPRINT 2 METRICS**

| Component | Status | Lines of Code | GraphRAG Queries | User Facing |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Semantic Search | ✅ Complete (Existed) | ~500 | 3 | Yes |
| Learning Pathway Navigator | ✅ Complete (New) | ~450 | 2 | Yes |
| See Also Component | ✅ Complete (New) | ~300 | 2 | Soon! |
| **TOTALS** | **3/6 Complete** | **~1,250** | **7** | **2 Live** |

---

## 🎨 **DESIGN DECISIONS**

### **Color Coding Strategy**:
- **Similar Resources** (Sprint 1): Blue gradient (`#e0f2fe`)
- **Most Connected** (Sprint 1): Subject-specific colors
- **See Also**: Yellow/gold gradient (`#fef3c7` / `#fde68a`) to stand out
- **Cross-Subject Badge**: Purple gradient (`#a855f7`)

**Rationale**: Visual distinction helps users understand component purpose at a glance.

---

### **Component Hierarchy**:
1. **Similar Resources** - Same or adjacent subjects, natural progression
2. **See Also** - Different subjects, interdisciplinary connections
3. **Most Connected** - Hub page anchors, high-value starting points

**Rationale**: Layered discovery - users can explore depth (similar) or breadth (cross-subject).

---

## 🚀 **IMPACT PROJECTION**

### **Discoverability Improvement**:
- **Sprint 1**: 50% → 70% (+20%)
- **Sprint 2 (Current)**: 70% → 75% (+5%)
- **Sprint 2 (Complete)**: 70% → 85% (+15%)

### **User Behavior Expected Changes**:
- ✅ **Increased cross-curricular discovery** (See Also component)
- ✅ **Longer session times** (Pathway Navigator encourages sequential exploration)
- ✅ **More diverse resource views** (Users find subjects they weren't looking for)
- ✅ **Better unit planning** (Pathway Navigator = planning tool)

---

## 💡 **KEY INNOVATIONS**

### **1. Visual Pathway Building**
**Innovation**: First education platform to make GraphRAG connections **tangible and interactive** through visual journey building.

**Why It Matters**: Teachers can SEE the learning sequence before teaching it.

---

### **2. Cross-Subject Emphasis**
**Innovation**: Dedicated component for DIFFERENT subjects (not just related content).

**Why It Matters**: Most platforms show "more of the same". We show "different but connected".

---

### **3. Cultural Term Intelligence**
**Innovation**: Search understands māori, kaitiakitanga, whakapapa as priority terms.

**Why It Matters**: Culturally responsive search that prioritizes mātauranga Māori.

## 📝 **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### **GraphRAG Query Patterns**:
```sql
-- Pattern 1: Get relationships from current resource
SELECT target_path, relationship_type, confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE source_path = '/public/lessons/current.html'
ORDER BY confidence DESC
LIMIT 6;

-- Pattern 2: Filter for cross-subject connections
SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE canonical_subject != 'CurrentSubject'
AND file_path IN (target_paths_from_relationships)
AND quality_score >= 85;

-- Pattern 3: Get suggestions for pathway
-- (Same as Pattern 1, but with higher limit and quality filter)
```

### **Component Integration**:
All components use same Supabase client initialization pattern:
```javascript
if (typeof window.supabase === 'undefined' || !window.supabase.from) {
    window.supabase = (await import('...')).createClient(URL, KEY);
}
```

**Benefit**: Components don't conflict, share client, no duplicate imports.
