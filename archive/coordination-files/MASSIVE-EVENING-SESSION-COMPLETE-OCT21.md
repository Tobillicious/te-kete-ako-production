4. Finds 1-2 resources if lucky
5. Total time: 15-20 minutes

**After (Tonight's Enhancement)**:
1. Lands on `/lessons/y9-science-climate-change-action.html`
2. Reads lesson
3. Scrolls to bottom → sees "🔗 Similar Resources" section
4. **Automatically discovers 6 related resources**:
   - Renewable Energy & Māori Innovation (Q90, 🌿)
   - Forces & Waka Design (Q92, "follows naturally")
   - Environmental Literacy Framework (Q90, cross-curricular)
