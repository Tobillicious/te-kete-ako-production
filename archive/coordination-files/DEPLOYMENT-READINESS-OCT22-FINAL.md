## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX: Netlify CSP Updated!**

### **Before:** `frame-src 'self';`
### **After:** `frame-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com https://www.youtube-nocookie.com;`

**Why:** We fixed 13 YouTube embeds today - they need CSP permission to load!

**Files Affected:**
- `treaty-of-waitangi-handout.html`
- `art-of-haka-handout.html`
- `climate-emergency-aotearoa-handout.html`
- `ted-power-yet-handout.html`
- Plus 6 video-activities and 3 other embedded video files
