## 🎯 **YOUR NEXT STEPS (HYBRID APPROACH):**

### **Step 1: Commit Today's Work** (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean

# Check what's changed

# Stage everything
git add .

# Use the commit message above (copy from this file!)
git commit -m "[paste commit message here]"
```

**Result:** ✅ Today's progress preserved in git history!

### **Step 2: Verify Netlify** (5 minutes)

**Manual Check:**
1. Visit: https://app.netlify.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Find "te-kete-ako" site (or similar)
4. Check:
   - ✅ Is it connected to GitHub repo?
   - ✅ What's the repo URL? (should be your current repo)
   - ✅ Did latest deploy trigger?
   - ✅ What's the deploy status? (success/failed/pending?)
   - ✅ What's the live site URL?

**Take Notes:**
- Repo connection: ________________
- Last deploy: ________________
- Site URL: ________________
- Any errors?: ________________

---

### **Step 3: Decision Point** (Based on Netlify Status)

**SCENARIO A: Netlify looks good ✅**
```
What you'll see:
- Connected to current repo ✅
- Recent deploys successful ✅
- Live site URL available ✅

YOUR NEXT COMMAND:
"Push to main and deploy!"

MY RESPONSE:
- Provide push instructions
- Guide you through testing on live site
- Run 5 test suites to validate everything
```

**SCENARIO B: Netlify has issues ⚠️**
```
What you might see:
- Connected to old/wrong repo
- Deploys failing
- No site configured
- Configuration errors

YOUR NEXT COMMAND:
"Netlify needs fixing, continue development"

MY RESPONSE:

- We'll deploy when infrastructure is ready
```

**SCENARIO C: Netlify unknown/needs setup 🆕**
```
What you might see:
- No site exists yet
- Need to create new site
- Need to connect repo

YOUR NEXT COMMAND:
"Set up Netlify from scratch" or "Try GitHub Pages instead"

MY RESPONSE:
- Guide you through Netlify setup
