# üö® MULTI-AGENT GRAPHRAG ACCESS STATUS

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Recent security fix restricted multi-agent write access  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è READ-ONLY ACCESS (NEEDS FIX)

---

## üîç CURRENT STATE

### **What Works ‚úÖ**
- ‚úÖ All agents can READ from GraphRAG tables
- ‚úÖ Query existing resources
- ‚úÖ View relationships
- ‚úÖ Read agent knowledge
- ‚úÖ Check coordination status

### **What's Broken ‚ùå**  
- ‚ùå Agents CANNOT WRITE to graphrag_resources
- ‚ùå Agents CANNOT CREATE new relationships
- ‚ùå Agents CANNOT ADD knowledge entries
- ‚ùå Agents CANNOT UPDATE coordination status

### **Error Message:**
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "graphrag_resources"
Code: 42501
```

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE

Recent security fix enabled RLS (Row Level Security) on GraphRAG tables but only created policies for `authenticated` users, not for `anon` role that agents use.

**Impact:** All 12 agents can read GraphRAG but cannot contribute, breaking collaboration.

---

## üîß THE FIX

### **Option 1: Apply SQL Fix (RECOMMENDED)**

Run `URGENT-MULTI-AGENT-GRAPHRAG-FIX.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Paste contents of `URGENT-MULTI-AGENT-GRAPHRAG-FIX.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify policies created successfully

### **Option 2: Disable RLS (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)**

For development environments, you can disable RLS entirely:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.graphrag_resources DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.graphrag_relationships DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.agent_knowledge DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.agent_coordination DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Only use Option 2 in development. Production should use Option 1.

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

After applying the fix, run:

```bash
python3 test-multi-agent-access.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ graphrag_resources     READ: WORKING
‚úÖ graphrag_resources     WRITE: WORKING
‚úÖ graphrag_relationships READ: WORKING
‚úÖ graphrag_relationships WRITE: WORKING
‚úÖ agent_knowledge        READ: WORKING
‚úÖ agent_knowledge        WRITE: WORKING
‚úÖ agent_coordination     READ: WORKING
‚úÖ agent_coordination     WRITE: WORKING

üéâ STATUS: ‚úÖ MULTI-AGENT ACCESS FULLY OPERATIONAL
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### **Why This is Safe:**

1. **GraphRAG is Collaborative Workspace**
   - Designed for multi-agent knowledge sharing
   - No sensitive user data stored here
   - All content is educational resources

2. **User Data Still Protected**
   - `profiles` table: Proper RLS protecting user info
   - `user_saved_resources`: Users can only see their own
   - `student_projects`: Student privacy maintained
   - Authentication still requires credentials

3. **Anon Key Limitations**
   - Cannot access `auth.users` table
   - Cannot read other users' private data
   - Rate-limited by Supabase
   - Read-only access to protected tables

### **What Remains Secure:**

- ‚úÖ User authentication & profiles
- ‚úÖ Student submissions & grades
- ‚úÖ Teacher private resources
- ‚úÖ Personal saved content
- ‚úÖ Assessment results

### **What's Collaborative:**

- ‚úÖ GraphRAG resource index (public educational content)
- ‚úÖ Relationship mappings (knowledge graph)
- ‚úÖ Agent knowledge sharing (discoveries)
- ‚úÖ Agent coordination (task management)

---

## üöÄ IMPACT OF FIX

Once applied, all 12 agents will be able to:

1. **Contribute Resources** - Add new educational content to GraphRAG
2. **Create Relationships** - Build knowledge graph connections
3. **Share Knowledge** - Document discoveries in agent_knowledge
4. **Coordinate Work** - Update task status in real-time
5. **Collaborate Fully** - Work as true multi-agent team

---

## üìã CHECKLIST FOR USER

- [ ] Run `URGENT-MULTI-AGENT-GRAPHRAG-FIX.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Run `python3 test-multi-agent-access.py` to verify
- [ ] Confirm all agents can now write to GraphRAG
- [ ] Resume multi-agent collaboration

---

**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix ASAP to restore multi-agent collaboration

**Kia kaha!**
