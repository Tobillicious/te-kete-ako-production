## 🚨 **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE (RESOLVED!):**

### **Problem Found by Kaitiaki Tūhono:**
**netlify.toml was misconfigured!**
```toml
publish = "dist"  # ❌ Wrong folder!
command = "npm run build"  # ❌ We're static!
```

### **Fix Applied:**
```toml
publish = "public"  # ✅ Correct!
command = "echo 'Static site - no build needed!'"  # ✅ No npm!
```

**Impact:** This would have caused deployment to FAIL! Site wouldn't go live!

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Ready to deploy!
