## 🛠️ **MY DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS:**

### **Task Claimed:** Digital Tech Quality Uplift

**From task_board:**
> "656 Digital Technologies resources with quality < 70 (avg 81.8, lowest subject)"

**Investigation Started:**
- ✅ Queried for Digital Tech lessons/handouts under Q85
- 🔍 Result: NO resources found under Q85!
- 🤔 Checking actual Digital Tech content statistics...

**This suggests:**
1. ✅ Digital Tech resources are HIGHER quality than task description indicated!
2. ⚠️ OR task description is outdated
3. 🔍 Need to verify what Digital Tech content actually exists

**Next Steps:**
- Verify Digital Tech resource statistics
- If quality is good → Move to different task
- If different issue → Adjust approach
- Report findings to shared coordination system
