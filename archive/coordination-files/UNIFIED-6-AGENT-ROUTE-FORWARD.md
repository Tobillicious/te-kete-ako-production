## 🧠 **GRAPHRAG DEEP INTELLIGENCE - KEY DISCOVERIES**

### **🚨 CRITICAL GAP #1: PREREQUISITE DESERT**
- **Only 2,116 prerequisite relationships** out of 238,347 total (0.9%!)
- **13,154 unit_contains_lesson relationships exist** but aren't formalized as chains
- **Opportunity:** Build ~11,000 more learning progression relationships!

**Year-Level Prerequisite Density:**
- Year 8: 1.61 (427 links / 265 resources) ✅ GOLD STANDARD
- Year 7: 0.20 (79 links / 399 resources) 🚨 CRITICAL
- Year 9: 0.18 (71 links / 392 resources) 🚨 CRITICAL
- Year 10: 0.13 (12 links / 94 resources) 🚨 CRITICAL

**Perfect Chain Models to Replicate:**
- Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga: **18 lessons @ 1.0 confidence** 🏆
- Y8 Critical Thinking: 4 lessons @ 1.0 confidence
- Y7 Algebra: 3 lessons @ 1.0 confidence
- Y9 Ecology: 6 lessons @ 1.0 confidence

---

### **🚨 CRITICAL GAP #2: EXCELLENCE CULTURAL GAP**
**Math/Science Excellence Resources Need Cultural Integration:**
- **Science:** 639 excellence resources (90+) without cultural context
- **Mathematics:** 592 excellence resources without cultural context
- **Total:** 1,231 of our BEST resources lack cultural depth!

**Current Excellence Cultural %:**
- English: 78.1% ✅
- Digital Tech: 63.4% ✅
- Social Studies: 59.3% ✅
- **Science: 42.6%** ⚠️ OPPORTUNITY!
- **Mathematics: 42.6%** ⚠️ OPPORTUNITY!

---

### **🚨 CRITICAL GAP #3: CULTURAL CONCEPT SILOS**
**Māori concepts locked to single subjects:**
- **Kaitiakitanga** → Only Science & Digital Tech (should be ALL!)
- **Whakapapa** → Only Mathematics (should be ALL!)
- **Pūrākau** → Only English (should be ALL!)
- **Te Taiao** → Only Science (should be ALL!)
- **Tikanga** → Only Social Studies (should be ALL!)
- **Manaakitanga** → Only Health & PE (should be ALL!)

**Vision:** Every subject honors ALL cultural foundations!

---

**20 high-quality resources (90+) with <5 connections:**
- Senior Subject Taxonomies (95 quality, 3 connections)
- Indigenous Learning Systems (93 quality, 4 connections)
- 17 archived English resources (92 quality, 1 connection each)
- Discovery frameworks (96 quality, 3 connections)

**Problem:** Invisible to students despite high quality!

---

### **🚨 CRITICAL GAP #5: CODE FILES DOMINATING**
- Top 15 most-connected resources are CODE/SYSTEM files
- `/assessments-complete.html` (4,676 conn) is only educational hub in top 20
- System connections drowning out educational pathways

**Solution:** Amplify educational resource connections!

---

### **🚨 CRITICAL GAP #6: UNDERUTILIZED RELATIONSHIP TYPES**
**30 semantic relationship types used only ONCE:**
- `critical_analysis`, `contemporary_issues`, `bicultural_competence`
- `applied_mathematics`, `career_pathway_sequence`, `arts_integration`

**Opportunity:** Systematize these powerful semantic patterns!
