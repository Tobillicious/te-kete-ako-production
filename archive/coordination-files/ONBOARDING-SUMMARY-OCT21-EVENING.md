## 🚀 **THE JOURNEY (July → October 2025)**

### **The Vision (July 29):**
*"Transform education in Aotearoa through the world's first AI-powered, culturally responsive learning ecosystem that honors indigenous knowledge systems."*

### **The Reality (October 21):**
**We're doing it.**

- From **624 → 17,196 resources** (2,755% growth)
- From **503 → 240,324 relationships** (47,779% growth!!)
- From **planning → execution** (6/8 priorities complete)
- From **6 → 12 agents** (distributed intelligence)
- From **vision → operational platform** (99% production ready)

### **The Pattern:**
Every session we:
1. Query GraphRAG (institutional memory)
2. Discover gaps (deep analysis)
3. Build solutions (actual code/content)
4. Teach GraphRAG (log learnings)
5. Evolve platform (continuous improvement)

---

## 🧠 **CRITICAL WORKFLOW (GraphRAG-First)**

### **Before Building ANYTHING:**
```sql
-- 1. Check if it exists
SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources WHERE title ILIKE '%your idea%';

-- 2. Check what agents learned
SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Query relationships
SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships WHERE source_path LIKE '%topic%';
```

### **After Building:**
```sql
-- Teach GraphRAG what you learned
INSERT INTO agent_knowledge (source_type, source_name, doc_type, key_insights, technical_details, agents_involved)
VALUES (...);
```

### **Key Rules:**
- ❌ **DON'T** create coordination MDs (we have 400+ already!)
- ✅ **DO** use ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md only
- ❌ **DON'T** use terminal commands (they hang per repo rules)
- ✅ **DO** use MCP Supabase exclusively
- ✅ Query first, build second, teach third

---

## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS FOR ALL AGENTS**

### **What Works:**
- ✅ Query GraphRAG FIRST (saves time, prevents duplication)
- ✅ Build relationships (not just resources)
- ✅ Follow Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga pattern (gold standard!)
- ✅ Use MCP Supabase (terminal commands hang)
- ✅ Focus on quality (56.8% Q90+ is our strength!)

### **What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Creating coordination MDs (we had 400+, now archived)
- ❌ Building without querying GraphRAG first
- ❌ Focusing on quantity over quality
- ❌ Ignoring existing patterns/templates
- ❌ Using terminal commands

### **Best Practices:**
- Build prerequisite chains (high confidence 0.95+)
- Add whakataukī to all Q90+ resources
- Create cross-subject bridges (0.80-0.90 confidence)
- Follow existing unit templates (Walker, Y8 Digital)
- Log learnings to agent_knowledge
