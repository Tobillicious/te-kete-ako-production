**Approach:** Deploy + Test + Continue Development  
**Expectation:** NOT finished, just want to see real status ✅  
**Timeline:** Deploy now, test while developing more!

---

## 📦 **STEP 1: YOU RUN THESE COMMANDS** (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean

# Stage everything
git add .

# Commit with today's epic work
git commit -m "🎉 EPIC SESSION OCT 22: 188 GraphRAG relationships + YouTube verified + Security

# Push to trigger Netlify deployment
git push origin main
```

**What happens next:**
- GitHub receives push ✅
- Netlify detects change (if connected)
- Auto-build triggers (or manual deploy needed)
- Site goes live in 1-3 minutes

---

## 🧪 **STEP 2: WHILE NETLIFY DEPLOYS - YOU CHECK** (5 minutes)

### **Find Your Live Site URL:**

**Option A: Netlify Dashboard**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site (look for "te-kete-ako" or similar)
3. Copy the URL (format: `https://something.netlify.app`)

**Option B: Netlify CLI** (if installed)
```bash
netlify sites:list
# Shows all your sites + URLs
```

**Option C: GitHub Pages** (if using that instead)
- URL format: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]`

---

## 🔍 **STEP 3: QUICK REALITY CHECK** (10 minutes)

### **Test 1: Does Site Load?** (2 min)
```
Visit: https://[YOUR-SITE-URL].netlify.app/

Expected: Homepage loads (even if imperfect!)
Check: Does ANYTHING show up?

✅ Success = Content visible
⚠️ Partial = Some errors but page loads
❌ Fail = Blank page or 404
```

### **Test 2: YouTube Embeds** (3 min)
```
Visit: /dist-handouts/treaty-of-waitangi-handout.html

Expected: YouTube video loads in iframe
Check: Do you see the video player?

✅ Success = Video embedded and playable
⚠️ Partial = Video link works but no embed
❌ Fail = CSP error in console (F12)
```

### **Test 3: Unit Index Pages** (3 min)
```
Visit: /units/y9-english-writing-chain/index.html

Expected: Beautiful 5-lesson showcase
Check: Does layout look professional?

✅ Success = Gradient header, lesson cards, mobile-responsive
⚠️ Partial = Content shows but styling off
❌ Fail = Page doesn't load
```

### **Test 4: GraphRAG Loading** (2 min)
```
Visit: /lessons.html

Expected: Lessons load from Supabase
Check: F12 console - any errors?

✅ Success = Lessons appear, no console errors
⚠️ Partial = Some lessons load, some errors
❌ Fail = "Failed to fetch" or CORS errors
```

---

## 📊 **STEP 4: REPORT BACK TO ME** (1 minute)

**Just tell me:**
- "Site loads!" or "Site broken"
- "YouTube works!" or "YouTube blocked"
- "GraphRAG works!" or "GraphRAG errors"
- Any console errors you see (F12)

**I don't need perfection - just REALITY!** 🎯

---

## 🛠️ **MEANWHILE, I'LL CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT!**

While you deploy + test, I'll work on:

**Next Development Tasks:**
1. **Digital Tech Quality Uplift** - Improve 656 resources
2. **HTML Cleanup** - Polish 18 restored files
3. **More Learning Chains** - Build additional progressions
4. **Component Deployment** - Similar Resources to more pages
5. **Mobile UX** - Chromebook viewport optimization

**From Shared Coordination System:**
- Claim next available high-priority task
- Keep building while you test
- Log all work to agent_knowledge
- Platform keeps improving!

---

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE (REALISTIC):**

### **✅ LIKELY WORKING:**
- Homepage loads (with some styling)
- Content is readable
- Navigation mostly functional
- Some YouTube embeds work
- Basic GraphRAG queries succeed

### **⚠️ LIKELY ISSUES:**
- Some styling inconsistencies
- Mobile view might be rough
- Some console warnings (non-critical)
- Not all components load perfectly
- Some images missing or slow

### **❌ POSSIBLE BLOCKERS:**
- CSP blocks something we didn't anticipate
- CORS issues with Supabase (rare but possible)
- Netlify config needs tweaking
- Some paths don't resolve correctly

**ALL OF THIS IS EXPECTED!** We're testing to find these! 🎯

---

## 💡 **AFTER YOUR TEST:**

**Tell me what you found, and I'll:**
- Fix any critical blockers immediately
- Prioritize issues by severity
- Continue development on non-blockers
- Iterate toward production-ready!

**This is AGILE development:**
1. Deploy early ✅ (today!)
2. Get feedback ✅ (your testing!)
3. Iterate quickly ✅ (my fixes + more dev!)
4. Improve continuously ✅ (never stop building!)

---

## 🌟 **YOUR EXPECTATIONS = PERFECT APPROACH!**

> "I'm not expecting a finished site. I just wanna see where we're really fully upto."

**This is EXACTLY the right mindset!**

**What we know:**
- ✅ 17K resources in GraphRAG
- ✅ 242K relationships built
- ✅ 57% excellent quality (9,979 resources Q90+!)
- ✅ 85%+ cultural integration
- ✅ Today's 188 relationships live

**What we DON'T know:**
- ❓ Does it all work on live Netlify?
- ❓ What breaks in real browsers?
- ❓ How's the actual UX?
- ❓ What needs fixing first?

**Your test will tell us!** 🔬

---

## 🚀 **GO TIME!**

**YOU:**
```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean
git add .
git commit -m "🎉 Deploy Oct 22 work - let's see real status!"
git push origin main
```

**THEN:**
- Wait 2-3 min for Netlify
- Visit your live URL
- Test 4 quick things (10 min)
- Tell me what you find!

**ME (STARTING NOW):**
- Claiming next development task
- Building more excellence
- Standing by for your test report
- Ready to fix any blockers!

**Let's see where we REALLY are! Kia kaha! 🧺✨**
