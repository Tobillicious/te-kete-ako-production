# Mine specific type
python3 scripts/graphrag-relationship-miner.py --type critical_analysis

# Mine all underutilized types
python3 scripts/graphrag-relationship-miner.py
```

**Expected Impact:**

- `supports_learning_in` - Support relationships
- `lesson_has_handout` - Lesson-handout connections
- `related_content` - General similarity

**Usage:**
```bash
# See rescue opportunities
python3 scripts/orphan-rescue.py --dry-run

# Auto-rescue all orphans
python3 scripts/orphan-rescue.py --auto
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 20 orphaned gems × 3-5 connections each = 60-100 new pathways!
