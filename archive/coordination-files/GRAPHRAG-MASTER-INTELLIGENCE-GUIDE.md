## üîç INTELLIGENCE QUERIES (Copy & Use!)

### Query 1: Super-Connected Hubs (100+ connections)
```sql
SELECT r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.quality_score,
       COUNT(rel.id) as connections
FROM graphrag_resources r
JOIN graphrag_relationships rel 
  ON r.file_path = rel.source_path OR r.file_path = rel.target_path
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.quality_score
HAVING COUNT(rel.id) >= 100
ORDER BY COUNT(rel.id) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Why:** Super-hubs have massive reach. Build FROM these for 100x impact.

**Top Hubs (from docs):**
- Algebraic Thinking MƒÅori Games: **221 connections**
- Biotechnology Ethics MƒÅori: 129 connections
- Data Visualization Cultural Demographics: 120 connections

### Query 2: Orphaned Gems (Q90+ with <5 connections)
```sql
SELECT r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.quality_score,
       COUNT(rel.id) as connections
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel 
  ON r.file_path = rel.source_path OR r.file_path = rel.target_path
WHERE r.quality_score >= 90
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title, r.subject, r.quality_score
HAVING COUNT(rel.id) < 5
ORDER BY r.quality_score DESC, COUNT(rel.id) ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Why:** High-quality resources that need connections. Low-hanging fruit for impact.

### Query 3: Recent Agent Discoveries (Past 30 Days)
```sql
SELECT source_name, 
       key_insights[1:3] as top_insights,
       technical_details->'priority' as priority,
       created_at
FROM agent_knowledge
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Why:** Learn from recent breakthroughs. Avoid repeating solved problems.

### Query 4: Cultural Integration by Subject
```sql
SELECT subject,
       COUNT(*) as total_resources,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cultural_context = true) as cultural_resources,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cultural_context = true) / COUNT(*), 1) as cultural_percentage
FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE subject IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY subject
ORDER BY cultural_percentage DESC;
```

**Why:** Identify subjects needing cultural enrichment.

**Current Benchmarks (from docs):**
- Social Studies: 100% ‚úÖ
- Digital Technologies: 100% ‚úÖ
- Science: 47% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Mathematics: 34% ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Query 5: Underutilized Relationship Types
```sql
SELECT relationship_type, 
       COUNT(*) as usage_count,
       AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
GROUP BY relationship_type
HAVING COUNT(*) < 10
ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC;
```

**Why:** 30 brilliant relationship types used only ONCE. Scale them for 100x value.

**Underutilized gems:**
- critical_analysis (1 use)
- bicultural_competence (1 use)
- applied_mathematics (1 use)
- career_pathway_sequence (1 use)

### Query 6: Most Effective Relationship Types
```sql
SELECT relationship_type,
       COUNT(*) as count,
       AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
GROUP BY relationship_type
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Why:** Use proven patterns. These relationship types create most value.

**Top Types (from docs):**
- unit_contains_lesson: 0.972 confidence ‚≠ê
- prerequisite_for: 0.950 confidence ‚≠ê
- shared_cultural_wisdom: 0.920 confidence ‚≠ê

### Query 7: Year-Level Progression Gaps
```sql
SELECT source_year_level, 
       target_year_level,
       COUNT(*) as bridge_count,
       AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM graphrag_relationships
WHERE relationship_type = 'prerequisite_for'
  AND source_year_level IS NOT NULL
  AND target_year_level IS NOT NULL
  AND source_year_level != target_year_level
GROUP BY source_year_level, target_year_level
ORDER BY bridge_count ASC;
```

**Why:** Identify weak year-level bridges. Students need clear progressions.

**Critical Gaps (from docs):**
- Y7‚ÜíY8: Only 4 bridges üî¥
- Y9‚ÜíY10: Only 3 bridges üî¥
- Y11‚ÜíY12: ~0 bridges üî•
- Y12‚ÜíY13: ~0 bridges üî•

### Query 8: Gold Standard Learning Chains
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE pathway AS (
  SELECT source_path, target_path, 1 as depth, 
         ARRAY[source_path, target_path] as path
  FROM graphrag_relationships
  WHERE relationship_type = 'prerequisite_for'
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT p.source_path, r.target_path, p.depth + 1,
         p.path || r.target_path
  FROM pathway p
  JOIN graphrag_relationships r ON p.target_path = r.source_path
  WHERE r.relationship_type = 'prerequisite_for'
    AND p.depth < 20
    AND NOT r.target_path = ANY(p.path)
)
SELECT path[1] as start_resource,
       path[array_length(path, 1)] as end_resource,
       array_length(path, 1) - 1 as chain_length
FROM pathway
ORDER BY chain_length DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Why:** Find perfect learning pathways. Replicate their structure.

**Gold Standard (from docs):**
- Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga: **18 sequential lessons**, 385 complete pathways, 0.958 confidence

## üíé PROVEN PATTERNS (Data-Validated Success)

### Pattern 1: Super-Hub Enrichment
**What:** Build relationships FROM/TO super-connected resources  
**Why:** Network effects multiply reach exponentially  
**Example:** Algebraic MƒÅori Games (221 connections) ‚Üí Connect to all math lessons ‚Üí Instant discoverability

**ROI:** One hub connection = 100+ resource reach

### Pattern 2: Y8 Digital Model Replication
**What:** Create 18-lesson sequential chains with 0.95+ confidence  
**Why:** Proven to create 385 complete learning pathways  
**Example:** Y7 Algebra ‚Üí 5 lessons ‚Üí Build sequential chain ‚Üí 50+ new pathways

**ROI:** 385 pathways per unit

### Pattern 3: Cultural Framework Threading
**What:** Connect resources sharing cultural frameworks (kaitiakitanga, tino rangatiratanga, etc.)  
**Why:** Cultural integration boosts quality AND connections  
**Example:** Digital Kaitiakitanga: 100% cultural, 90.5 quality, 123 prerequisites

**ROI:** Culture = Quality multiplier

### Pattern 4: Orphan Rescue
**What:** Connect Q90+ resources with <5 connections to learning pathways  
**Why:** Makes excellence discoverable  
**Example:** 47 orphaned alpha resources (Q90+) ‚Üí Link to curriculum ‚Üí Massive value unlock
