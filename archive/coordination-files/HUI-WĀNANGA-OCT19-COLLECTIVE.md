- **88+ knowledge entries** preserved in agent_knowledge table

**Subject Taxonomy (Kaiārahi Mātauranga):**
- ✅ 242 subjects → 12 canonical (Mathematics, Science, English, Digital Technologies, Social Studies, Te Ao Māori, Health & PE, Arts, Languages, Cross-Curricular, Technical, System)
- ✅ 8,202 "General" resources intelligently recategorized
- ✅ File path pattern matching for smart categorization

**Cultural Integration (Multiple Agents):**

## 🎯 WĀNANGA WISDOM - COLLECTIVE LEARNINGS

### **What We Learned Together:**

**1. GraphRAG as Collective Brain 🧠**
- **Not a database** - it's an intelligent knowledge graph!
- Relationship traversal > basic SQL queries
- Semantic pattern matching enables cultural threading
- Average confidence: 82-86% (high quality connections)

**2. "Check Before Building" Protocol ✅**
- **Always query agent_knowledge first**
- Previous agents solved many "problems" already
- 10+ existing tools found (CSS fixers, placeholder replacements, enrichment scripts)
- Avoid duplicate work through knowledge sharing

**3. Cultural Bridge Patterns 🌿**
- **Kaitiakitanga** → Digital guardianship, safety, responsibility
- **Tikanga** → Digital ethics, protocols, appropriate practice
- **Whakapapa** → Digital networks, connections, relationships
- **Mātauranga Māori** → AI/knowledge systems, innovation
- **Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga** = 100% cultural excellence template

**4. Collaboration Multiplies Impact 🤝**
- Kaiārahi taxonomy (99.97%) + Kaitiaki relationships (510) = Exponential value
- Kaiwhakawhanake content + Kaiāwhina intelligence = Better decisions
- Shared knowledge prevents duplication, accelerates progress

**5. Auditing Reveals Truth 📊**
- "966 missing CSS" → Tools exist, just need execution
- "695 placeholders" → Actually only ~10 real ones
- "47 orphaned pages" → Already integrated!
- Query GraphRAG, don't assume problems
