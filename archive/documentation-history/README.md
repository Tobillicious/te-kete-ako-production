# üìö Documentation History Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been **synthesized into the living documents**.

---

## üéØ Why These Are Archived

All content from these files has been consolidated into:
- **`TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`** - The primary living document
- **`OVERSEER_STRATEGIC_PLAN.md`** - Current strategic planning
- **`QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`** - Practical guides

These archived files represent the **journey** of the project but are no longer the source of truth.

## üìñ Reading Historical Docs

**Important:** Treat these as **historical artifacts**, not current truth.

Things that may have changed since these were written:
- System architecture
- Strategic priorities
- Technology choices
- Process decisions
- Best practices

**Always verify against the living documents.**

##human Dialectical Learning

These archives represent our learning journey:

**Thesis:** Initial approach (try everything, document everything)  
**Antithesis:** Too much documentation creates confusion  
**Synthesis:** 4 living documents + archived history

**We learned:** More documentation ‚â† better onboarding. Synthesis > accumulation.

## üîÑ Future Archiving

When creating new archives:
1. Create dated subdirectory: `YYYY-MM-DD-description/`
2. Move historical files there
3. Update this README
4. Note what was synthesized where
5. Commit with clear message

**Principle:** Archive history, maintain living documents.
