## üîç FINDINGS

### CSS Files Present (19 total!):
1. te-kete-professional.css (main - used by index, lessons, handouts)
2. print.css
3. critical.css
4. design-system-v3.css (26KB!)
5. enhanced-beauty-system.css (20KB!)
6. kehinde-wiley-design-system.css (12KB)
7. kehinde-wiley-implementation.css (8.5KB)
8. curriculum-style.css
9. handout-style.css
10. handout.css (duplicate?)
11. lesson-plan.css
12. digital-purakau.css
13. ... and more

### THE PROBLEM:
Multiple CSS files with OVERLAPPING styles = conflicts!

### Pages Use:
- index.html, lessons.html, handouts.html: te-kete-professional.css ‚úÖ
- But 19 files exist, some probably loading and conflicting

### SOLUTION NEEDED:
1. Audit which CSS files are actually used
2. Remove/archive unused files
3. Consolidate to ONE primary system (te-kete-professional.css)
4. Test site looks better
