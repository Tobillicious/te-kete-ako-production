## 📋 PHASE 1: TECHNICAL FOUNDATION (Week 1)

### **1.1 Authentication System Cleanup**
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Problem:** Multiple failed authentication attempts causing conflicts  
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Identify all auth systems
find . -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "auth\|login\|signup" {} \;
find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "auth\|login\|signup" {} \;

# Choose ONE system (Supabase recommended)
# Remove all others systematically
```
