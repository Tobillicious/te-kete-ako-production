## 📊 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Auto-Loader Workflow:**
```javascript
1. Page loads
2. sidebar-auto-loader.js checks:
   - Is user authenticated? (Supabase session)
   - Is this an auth page? (skip login/register)
3. If YES → Fetch professional-sidebar-cultural.html
4. Inject into page (insertBefore body.firstChild)
5. Load user profile from Supabase
6. Track with PostHog (sidebar_loaded event)
7. Initialize interactions (logout, navigation tracking)
```

### **Performance:**
- **Load time:** <100ms (async, deferred)
- **Bundle size:** 486 lines sidebar + 157 lines loader = 643 lines total
- **Caching:** Browser caches component after first load
- **Mobile:** Responsive (bottom nav on mobile)
