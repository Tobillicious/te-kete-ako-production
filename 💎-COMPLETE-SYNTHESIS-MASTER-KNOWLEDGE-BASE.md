## üìö **THE 24 UNIVERSAL LAWS**

### **Category 1: Truth & Validation**
1. **Reality ‚â† Documentation** - Verify everything, trust nothing
2. **Root Cause > Symptoms** - Fix fundamentals, not surface
3. **Ground Truth > Grand Vision** - Validate assumptions before scaling
4. **Built ‚â† Integrated** - Report backend AND frontend separately

### **Category 2: Development Philosophy**
5. **Discovery > Creation** - Use what exists before building new
6. **Check Before Create** - GraphRAG query mandatory
7. **Activation > Creation** - Use what's built before building more
8. **First Good > Later Perfect** - Original implementations often better
9. **Subtraction Before Addition** - Remove mediocre before adding

### **Category 3: Quality & Shipping**
10. **Ship > Plan** - Real usage beats theoretical perfection
11. **Impact Before Perfection** - Fix high-impact fast, perfect incrementally
12. **Perfect Critical Path, Ship Good Enough** - 100% on what matters, 85% overall
13. **Curated Excellence > Comprehensive** - 580 GOLD > 5,794 mediocre
14. **Addition Requires Subtraction** - Every new file = remove old

### **Category 4: Design & UX**
15. **Default Simple, Optional Complex** - Progressive disclosure
16. **Professional + Transcendent = Both** - Technical + cultural soul
17. **Culture Leads, Design Follows** - Cultural content first, design serves
18. **Cultural Foundation, Professional Execution** - Start cultural, add professional
19. **Demo = Production Unity** - One polished product, no divergence

### **Category 5: Scaling & Coordination**
20. **Perfect One ‚Üí Perfect All** - Master template before scaling
21. **Local Excellence ‚Üí Global Scale** - Prove micro before macro
22. **Vision Inspires, Foundation Enables** - Keep goals, build prerequisite stages
23. **Async > Sync for AI** - AI agents coordinate better asynchronously
24. **Infrastructure Enables Autonomy** - Strong systems allow independent excellence

## üåü **FOR FUTURE AI AGENTS**

### **Before Creating Anything:**
```
1. Query this knowledge base
2. Check if it exists already (Law #5: Discovery > Creation)
3. Evaluate if existing is 80% good (Law #8: First Good > Later Perfect)
4. Only create if genuine gap (Law #6: Check Before Create)
5. Integrate immediately (Law #4: Built ‚â† Integrated)
6. Document for future agents (continuous knowledge building)
```

### **When Making Decisions:**
```
1. Apply Universal Laws (24 principles)
2. Check dialectic resolutions (25 conflicts resolved)
3. Review anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
4. Follow success patterns (what TO do)
5. Acknowledge uncertainty (confidence levels)
6. Seek cultural validation (if cultural content)
```

### **When Coordinating:**
```
1. Use async-first (Law #23: Async > Sync)
2. ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md for communication
3. GraphRAG for knowledge sharing
4. MCP for status awareness
5. Coordinate at boundaries (Law #10 from Oct 25)
6. Build > meet (proven productivity)
```
