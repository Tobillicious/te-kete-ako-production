## 🚀 Quick Start for New Agents

1. **Read First**: [Agent Onboarding Guide](development-workflow/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md)
2. **Understand Context**: [Current Architecture Overview](architecture/README.md)
3. **Follow Protocols**: [Communication Guidelines](agent-protocols/COMMUNICATION_GUIDELINES.md)
4. **Check Status**: [Current Progress](project-status/phase-completion-log.md)

## 🌟 Key Principles

### Cultural Authenticity
- **Te Ao Māori Values**: All decisions honor manaakitanga, whakatōhia, and kaitiakitanga
- **Community-Centered**: Mangakōtukutuku College ākonga are at the heart of every decision
- **Respectful Integration**: Technology serves pedagogy, not the reverse

### Collaborative Excellence
- **Transparent Communication**: All agents document decisions and context
- **Efficient Handoffs**: Clear protocols for transferring work between agents
- **Collective Learning**: Knowledge is shared, not siloed

### Technical Standards
- **User-First Design**: Every feature prioritizes educator and student experience
- **Security by Design**: Student data protection is non-negotiable
- **Scalable Architecture**: Systems designed for growth and reliability

## 📈 Current Status (Updated July 28, 2025)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Previous status information was inaccurate. See `onboarding/CURRENT_STATUS_JULY_28_2025.md` for accurate current state.

### 🚨 Major Issues Identified
- **Y8 Systems Unit Missing** from live site (complete 5-week program exists locally)
- **Resources removed** rather than added in recent sessions
- **Content synchronization** problems between local and live
- **Authentication unclear** - may be working on live, issues with local testing

### ✅ What's Actually Working
- **Live site functional** at https://tekete.netlify.app/
- **~190 educational resources** properly organized
- **Supabase database** fully deployed with schema
- **Cultural integration** authentic throughout
- **Games and interactive content** functional

### 🎯 Immediate Priorities (Corrected)
1. **Full site audit** - Compare live vs local systematically
2. **Deploy Y8 Systems unit** - Missing major educational content
3. **Fix genuine broken links** - Not rebuild working systems
4. **Test before changing** - Don't assume things are broken

### 📋 Agent Guidelines (Updated)
- **Audit first** before making any changes
- **Test existing** functionality before "fixing"
- **Focus on gaps** not rebuilding working features
- **Document accurately** for future agents

## 🤝 Collaboration Protocols

## 🎓 Educational Philosophy

Te Kete Ako operates on the principle that technology should amplify culturally-grounded, relationship-centered education. Every feature, every design decision, and every line of code serves the goal of empowering ākonga to see themselves as capable, culturally-grounded leaders who can shape their communities and their world.

## 📋 Documentation Standards

### Required for All Additions
- **Cultural Impact Assessment**: How does this change honor or affect Te Ao Māori values?
- **Student-Centered Justification**: How does this directly benefit ākonga learning?
- **Technical Sustainability**: How does this support long-term maintenance and growth?
- **Security Considerations**: How does this protect student and educator data?

### Documentation Format
- Use clear, accessible language (avoid technical jargon when possible)
- Include practical examples and implementation details
- Reference cultural authenticity and pedagogical research where relevant
- Maintain version history for all major changes
