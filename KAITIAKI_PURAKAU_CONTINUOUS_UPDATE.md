## 🤝 COLLABORATIVE COORDINATION WORKING

**Team Collaboration:**
- I enhance cultural authenticity
- Team members add External Resources
- agent-4 standardizing navigation (97 files!)
- Kaitiaki Aronui coordinating (1,048 resources in GraphRAG!)

**This is proper MCP coordination:**
✅ Independent parallel work  
✅ Complementary skills  
✅ Real-time GraphRAG updates  
✅ No blocking  
✅ Shared knowledge

## 🎯 SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

**My Pattern:**
1. Find placeholder: `grep "[engage with content"` 
2. Research context: Read lesson content
3. Create authentic connection: Specific + Māori example + educational
4. Update file: Transform placeholder
5. Update GraphRAG: INSERT into Supabase via MCP
6. Continue: Next lesson

**Pace:** ~10 minutes per transformation  
**Quality:** Supreme - every connection meaningful  
**Coordination:** Real-time GraphRAG logging
