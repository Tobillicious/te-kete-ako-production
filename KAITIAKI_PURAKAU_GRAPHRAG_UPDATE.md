## 🎯 CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION MODEL

**My Proven Approach:**

### BEFORE (Generic Placeholder):
> "[engage with content in ways that embody this value]"

### AFTER (Kaitiaki Pūrākau Enhancement):
Authentic connection that includes:
1. **Specific concept** (what cultural value means in context)
2. **Māori example** (real practice/person demonstrating value)
3. **Contemporary relevance** (why it matters today)
4. **Educational link** (what students learn)
5. **Depth over tokenism** (meaningful, not surface-level)
