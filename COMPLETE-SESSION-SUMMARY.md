- **Part-Of:** Resource belongs to unit relationships

---

## üåü PRODUCTION STATUS

**Live Files:** 999 approved + 24 "needs work" = **1,023 production files**

**Quality Distribution:**
- 97% approved (excellent!)
- 3% need minor work (mostly test pages/components)

**Production is CLEAN and PROFESSIONAL** ‚úÖ

---

## üíé ARCHIVE GOLD DISCOVERED

**5,597 approved files in archives!**

**Top finds:**
- NCEA resources
- Additional handouts
- Better lesson versions
- Missing features
- Cultural frameworks

**Next:** Mine these systematically to restore valuable content

---

## üîó GRAPHRAG KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

**When Uploaded (Ready Now):**

```sql
-- Find all Year 8 math resources
SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE content_path LIKE '%y8%' 
AND content_path LIKE '%math%';

-- Find prerequisites for a lesson
SELECT r.* FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN graphrag_resources r ON rel.from_path = r.content_path
WHERE rel.to_path = './public/units/unit-1/lesson-3.html'
AND rel.relationship_type = 'prerequisite';

-- Find similar resources
SELECT r.* FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN graphrag_resources r ON rel.to_path = r.content_path
WHERE rel.from_path = './public/lessons/walker/lesson-1.html'
AND rel.relationship_type = 'similar_topic'
ORDER BY rel.confidence DESC;

-- Get complete learning path
WITH RECURSIVE learning_path AS (
  SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources WHERE title = 'Unit 1 Lesson 1'
  UNION
  SELECT r.* FROM graphrag_resources r
  JOIN graphrag_relationships rel ON r.content_path = rel.to_path
  JOIN learning_path lp ON lp.content_path = rel.from_path
  WHERE rel.relationship_type = 'next_in_sequence'
)
SELECT * FROM learning_path;
```

**This enables:**
- Intelligent search
- Automatic recommendations
- Learning path generation
- Content discovery
- Gap analysis
