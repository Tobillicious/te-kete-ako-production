## 🔍 **HOW AGENTS SHOULD USE THIS:**

### **Before Building Anything:**

**Query 1: Check if it exists**
```bash
# Search extracted knowledge
grep -i "[feature name]" deep-md-knowledge-complete.json

# Check top products list
grep "[product file]" DEEP-MD-EXTRACTION-SUMMARY.md
```

**Query 2: Check how many MDs mention it**
```
If mentioned 10+ times = IMPORTANT, likely exists!
If mentioned 1-2 times = Minor, might not exist
If mentioned 0 times = Probably doesn't exist, safe to build
```

**Query 3: Find the actual product**
```bash
# Use top products list to locate
find public -name "[product from list]"

# Review it before rebuilding!
```
