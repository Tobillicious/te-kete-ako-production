                    <p>The Aotearoa Wars of the 19th century were not just a series of chaotic battles. They were a strategic contest between two vastly different military traditions. To view Māori simply as "brave warriors" is to miss their brilliance as strategists, engineers, and tacticians who repeatedly out-thought a global superpower.</p>

                        <p>When the British arrived with cannons, the high-hill pā became obsolete. In response, Māori engineers designed a new type of pā. Built on flat land, it featured deep trenches, anti-artillery bunkers, and camouflaged palisades. These fortresses were designed to absorb cannon fire and draw the British forces into a deadly, close-quarters fight. The British were shocked by their effectiveness.</p>

                        <p>Riwha Tītokowaru, a leader from Ngāti Ruanui, perfected a hit-and-run strategy. He refused to engage the British in large, set-piece battles where they had the advantage. Instead, he launched surprise raids on their supply lines and forts, causing maximum disruption with minimum casualties. He used his deep knowledge of the land to appear and disappear, creating fear and uncertainty among the colonial troops.</p>

                        <p>At the famous battle of Ruapekapeka, Māori built an incredibly complex fortress. The British spent weeks bombarding it. When they finally stormed the pā, they found it mostly empty. The defenders had slipped out the back through a series of hidden trenches and escape routes, leaving the British to capture a worthless position at great cost. This was a strategic victory designed to exhaust the enemy's resources and morale.</p>
