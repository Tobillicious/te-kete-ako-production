                <h2 class="section-title">How AI is Changing Our World</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI), the simulation of human intelligence in machines, is no longer science fiction; it's a part of everyday life in Aotearoa. When you get a movie recommendation from Netflix or see a personalised ad on social media, you are interacting with an AI. These systems use complex algorithms to analyse vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions. In New Zealand, AI is being adopted across various sectors. In agriculture, for instance, AI-powered drones can monitor crop health and apply fertiliser with precision, reducing waste and environmental impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The potential of AI in healthcare is particularly significant. Researchers at the University of Otago are training AI models to detect early signs of skin cancer from images with an accuracy rate that could soon surpass human dermatologists. One model achieved a 95% accuracy rate in identifying malignant melanomas in a recent trial. This could lead to faster, more accessible diagnostics for people in remote areas. However, the use of AI also raises ethical questions. Who is responsible if an AI makes a mistake in a diagnosis? How do we ensure that the data used to train these systems is unbiased and representative of all New Zealanders, including Māori and Pasifika peoples?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As AI becomes more integrated into our society, the conversation about its impact on jobs is growing louder. While some roles may be automated, many experts believe AI will create new jobs that require different skills. The focus is shifting towards human-AI collaboration, where AI handles repetitive tasks, freeing up humans to concentrate on creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving. The challenge for New Zealand's education system is to prepare students for this future, equipping them with the adaptability and digital literacy skills needed to thrive in an AI-driven world.
