                <p>
                    Environmental issues are complex, involving science, politics, economics, and culture. When we read about environmental topics, we need to be critical detectives, asking: Who wrote this? What's their purpose? What evidence do they use? What voices are missing? This analysis framework helps you decode environmental texts, from scientific papers to government policies to media reports.

                    <p>"New Zealand's transition to a low-carbon economy presents significant economic opportunities. Our analysis suggests that green technology investments could create up to 100,000 new jobs by 2030. The government's carbon pricing mechanism incentivizes innovation while ensuring business competitiveness. However, transitional support for traditional industries remains essential. Critics argue that the timeline is too aggressive, but international commitments under the Paris Agreement require decisive action. The framework prioritizes market-based solutions that balance environmental goals with economic growth."</p>
