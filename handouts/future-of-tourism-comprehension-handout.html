                <h2 class="section-title">Reimagining Tourism in Aotearoa</h2>
                <p>
                    Before 2020, tourism was New Zealand's largest export industry, contributing nearly $41 billion to the economy and supporting almost 8.4% of the national workforce. The model was largely based on high volume, with millions of international visitors flocking to iconic destinations like Queenstown and Milford Sound. However, this "high-volume" approach placed significant strain on local infrastructure and the environment. Overcrowding, freedom camping issues, and the carbon footprint of long-haul travel led many to question the sustainability of this model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The global pandemic forced a hard reset. With borders closed, New Zealand's tourism industry had to pivot to a domestic-only market. This period of disruption, while economically painful, provided a unique opportunity to rethink the future. The concept of "regenerative tourism" has gained traction, shifting the focus from simply sustaining the environment to actively improving it. This model encourages visitors to connect more deeply with local communities and culture, and to leave a place better than they found it. Examples include tourists participating in native tree planting days or contributing to local conservation projects as part of their visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As international travel resumes, the key challenge is balancing economic recovery with these new sustainable ideals. Some operators are targeting "high-quality" tourists‚Äîvisitors who stay longer, spend more, and engage in lower-impact activities. This could mean fewer visitors overall, but a greater economic return per person. However, this approach has been criticised as potentially elitist, making New Zealand a destination only for the wealthy. The government and industry must now navigate this complex path, aiming to build a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive tourism model that enriches both the visitors and the unique environment of Aotearoa.
