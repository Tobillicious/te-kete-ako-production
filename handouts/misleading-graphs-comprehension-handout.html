                    In a world saturated with information, we often rely on graphs and statistics to help us understand complex topics. From news reports to advertisements, data visualisation is a powerful tool. However, this tool can be used to mislead as well as to inform. A misleading graph is one that distorts data to create a false impression. One of the most common techniques is manipulating the Y-axis (the vertical axis) on a bar or line graph. By starting the axis at a value other than zero, or by stretching or compressing the scale, small differences can be made to look enormous, or significant changes can be made to look trivial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider two snack food companies. Company A sells 5,200 units and Company B sells 5,000 units. The actual difference is only 200 units, or 4% of Company B's sales. A truthful graph with a Y-axis starting at 0 would show two bars of very similar height. However, if a marketer for Company A creates a graph where the Y-axis starts at 4,800 and ends at 5,400, Company A's bar will appear to be more than twice as tall as Company B's. This visual trick exaggerates the difference and can mislead a consumer into thinking one product is vastly more popular than the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another common issue is cherry-picking data. This involves selecting only the data that supports a particular argument while ignoring data that contradicts it. For example, a report might claim that "ice cream sales cause an increase in drownings" by showing that both rise in the summer. This ignores the lurking variable—the hot weather—that is the actual cause of both. Being statistically literate is a crucial skill in the modern world. It involves more than just reading the numbers; it requires us to question the source of the data, look at the scales on graphs, and think critically about what information might be missing.
