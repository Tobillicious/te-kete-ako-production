                <h2 class="section-title">The Brain's Nightly Housekeeper</h2>
                <p>
                    For centuries, sleep was considered a passive state of rest. We now know that it is an active and essential biological process, as vital for our survival as breathing or eating. During sleep, the brain is hard at work performing critical maintenance tasks. One of its key jobs is memory consolidation. While you sleep, the brain sorts through the day's experiences, transferring important information from your short-term memory to your long-term memory. This is why a good night's sleep after studying can significantly improve your recall during a test.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another crucial function is the brain's "glymphatic system," which acts like a waste-disposal unit. During the day, the brain's metabolic processes produce toxic by-products that accumulate. While you are asleep, the glymphatic system becomes 10 times more active, flushing out these toxins. This nightly cleaning process is thought to be vital for long-term brain health. For teenagers, sleep is particularly important. The adolescent brain is undergoing massive development, and sleep is when much of this growth and reorganisation occurs. Furthermore, the body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, naturally shifts during adolescence, making teenagers feel tired later at night and want to wake up later in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most teenagers require between 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night for optimal health. However, studies show that a majority get far less, often due to a combination of early school start times, homework, and exposure to blue light from screens before bed, which can suppress the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to a host of problems, including difficulty concentrating, poor academic performance, mood swings, and a weakened immune system. Prioritising sleep is not a luxury; it is a fundamental component of physical and mental wellbeing.
