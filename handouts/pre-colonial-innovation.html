                    <p class="text-gray-700">Long before European arrival, Aotearoa was a hub of sophisticated technology and engineering. Māori innovation was driven by need, shaped by the environment, and guided by mātauranga Māori. This was not primitive survival; it was a story of advanced adaptation.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Pā were far more than simple forts. They were complex, multi-layered defensive systems featuring terraces, trenches, and palisades. Their design showed a deep understanding of physics, engineering, and military strategy, often built on strategically chosen hills to maximize defensibility.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Māori adapted the tropical kūmara to a much cooler climate. They developed innovative techniques, such as using sand and gravel to change the soil temperature and improve drainage, creating vast, successful gardens that fed large communities. This was a major feat of agricultural science.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The double-hulled canoe, or waka hourua, was a masterpiece of naval architecture. These vessels were capable of sailing thousands of kilometres across the open Pacific. Their design, combined with the sophisticated understanding of stars and currents, represents one of the greatest achievements in human exploration.</p>
