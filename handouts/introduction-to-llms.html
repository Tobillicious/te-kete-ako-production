                        <h2>What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?</h2>
                        <p>A Large Language Model is a type of artificial intelligence that has been trained on a massive amount of text data. This training allows it to understand the patterns, grammar, and context of human language. Its core function is to predict the next most likely word in a sequence, which enables it to generate human-like text, answer questions, translate languages, and much more.</p>

                            <p>In MƒÅori worldview, language (reo) is considered a <em>taonga</em> (treasure). As we explore AI language models, we must consider how they handle indigenous languages and cultural knowledge responsibly.</p>

                            <p>LLMs are trained on vast datasets from the internet, books, and other sources. This is how they "learn" language patterns and knowledge. However, this is also the source of potential bias, as the training data may not represent all perspectives equally.</p>
