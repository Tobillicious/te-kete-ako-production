                    <p>When Dame Whina Cooper and the marchers of the 1975 Land March arrived at Parliament, they did not come with empty hands. They carried a "Memorial of Right," a formal petition signed by thousands. This document was their evidence. It was a carefully constructed argument, grounded in law and history, designed to persuade the government to act.</p>
                    <p>Below are selected (recreated) excerpts from this powerful primary source. Your task is to use them to construct your own PEEL paragraph.</p>

When the land is lost, our connection to our tūrangawaewae is severed, and our culture is left without a home. We assert that the health of our people is tied inextricably to the health of our land..."</em></p>
