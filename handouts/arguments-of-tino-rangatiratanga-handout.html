                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        In 1975, a group of M캐ori leaders, led by Dame Whina Cooper, organized a march from the top of the North Island to Parliament in Wellington. The h캶koi (march) was a protest against the ongoing loss of M캐ori land. The arguments they made were not just emotional; they were carefully structured, powerful, and designed to persuade a nation. This handout analyzes those arguments using the PEEL structure.

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">This was the central, unifying point of the entire movement. It was a clear, concise, and powerful statement of their goal. It argued that the historical process of land alienation had to stop immediately.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-700">E - Evidence: The Memorial of Right</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The marchers carried a 'Memorial of Right' to Parliament. This document was their key piece of evidence. It detailed the specific laws and government actions that had led to the loss of millions of acres of land since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It listed statutes, dates, and the exact amount of land lost, providing factual evidence to support their point.</p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-700">E - Explanation: The Betrayal of Te Tiriti</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The leaders explained that this land loss was not just an economic issue; it was a betrayal of the promises made in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. They explained that the Treaty was supposed to protect M캐ori tino rangatiratanga (sovereignty, self-determination), including their right to their lands. The loss of land, they explained, was a direct assault on their culture, identity, and mana.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-700">L - Link: A Call for Justice</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The march linked the historical evidence of land loss directly to a call for present-day action. By walking the length of the island, they physically linked the land to the seat of power in Wellington. The final link was their demand: that the government honour the Treaty, protect the remaining M캐ori land, and begin a process of redress for past injustices. This led directly to the creation of the Waitangi Tribunal.</p>
