                    <p class="text-gray-700">Established in 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal is a permanent commission of inquiry. Its purpose is to hear claims brought by Māori relating to breaches of the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal's findings are not binding, but its reports have had a profound influence on law, policy, and the process of reconciliation in Aotearoa.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">This groundbreaking report found that Te Reo Māori was a taonga (treasure) that the Crown was obligated to protect under the Treaty. The Tribunal recommended a range of measures to protect and promote the language. This led directly to Te Reo Māori becoming an official language of New Zealand in 1987.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">This was one of the largest and most complex claims, covering most of the South Island. The Tribunal found that the Crown had acted unconscionably in its land dealings with the Ngāi Tahu iwi, failing to set aside the promised reserves. This report paved the way for a major Treaty settlement in 1998.</p>
