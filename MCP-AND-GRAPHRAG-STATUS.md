# 🤝 MCP & GRAPHRAG - Multi-Agent Intelligence System

**MCP:** Model Context Protocol - Communication backbone for 12 agents  
**GraphRAG:** Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation - The shared brain  
**Status:** Infrastructure exists, partially active  

---

## 📡 THE MCP (MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL)

### **What It Is:**
Communication protocol enabling 12 AI agents to:
- Share knowledge in real-time
- Coordinate tasks
- Avoid duplicate work
- Make collective decisions
- Query shared brain (GraphRAG)

### **MCP Servers Found:**
You have **9 different MCP server implementations!**

1. `mcp-server.js` - Basic server
2. `mcp-server-simple.js` - Simplified version
3. `mcp-server-enhanced.js` - Enhanced features
4. `mcp-server-12-agents.js` - 12-agent coordination
5. `mcp-server-supabase.js` - Supabase integration
6. `mcp-server-graphrag-central.js` - **GraphRAG as central brain** ⭐
7. `mcp-server-supabase-graphrag.js` - Combined
8. `mcp-supabase-connector.js` - Connector
9. `mcp-agent-connector.js` - Agent connector

### **MCP Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq"
    }
  }
}
```

**Connection:** Direct to Supabase database  
**Purpose:** Enable agents to query GraphRAG directly

## 🧠 WHAT OTHER AGENTS SAY ABOUT GRAPHRAG

### **From MCP-AGENT-COORDINATION.json (Oct 14):**

**Agent Status at that time:**
- 9 of 12 agents were online
- They identified GraphRAG coverage gap: **Only 15.1%** (217 of 1,436 files)
- **Their recommendation:** "Populate GraphRAG with 1,219 missing files"

**Strategic Opportunity they identified:**
> "84.9% of content could be added to GraphRAG for searchability"

**They were RIGHT!** We've now grown from 217 → **17,697 resources**!

### **From Agent-9's Report (Agent-9a4dd0d0 - Lead QA):**

**On GraphRAG Coverage:**
- Noted 217 files in GraphRAG (at that time)
- Recommended full indexing
- Focused on quality over quantity

**Cultural Integration findings:**
- 1,242 files with Whakataukī (61.4% of production)
- 742 files with Tikanga
- 508 files with Whakapapa
- **Excellent cultural depth!**

### **From Agent Coordination Files:**

**Agent-6 (Resource Management):**
> "GraphRAG is the source of truth - all agents must query it before making decisions"

**Agent-3 (Content):**
> "Cultural content needs to be validated in GraphRAG before deployment"

**Agent-10 (Coordination):**
> "MCP + GraphRAG = prevents context drift across 12 agents"

## 🎯 THE GRAPHRAG-CENTRAL MCP DESIGN

**From `mcp-server-graphrag-central.js`:**

### **Core Principle:**
"Forces all 12 agents to collaborate through the knowledge graph"

### **Endpoints Available:**

1. **/status** - See all agent statuses + GraphRAG count
2. **/check-in** - Agents report their current work
3. **/query-knowledge** - Search GraphRAG for information
4. **/add-knowledge** - Add discoveries to shared brain
5. **/propose-decision** - Suggest coordination decisions
6. **/get-decisions** - See what others proposed
7. **/collaborate** - Initiate agent-to-agent collaboration
8. **/claim-task** - Claim a task (prevents duplication)
9. **/update-task** - Report progress
10. **/complete-task** - Mark task done

### **Philosophy:**
**"All decisions MUST go through GraphRAG"** - Prevents agents working against each other

## 📊 MCP + GRAPHRAG WORKING TOGETHER

### **The System Design:**

```
12 CURSOR AGENTS
      ↓
    MCP Server (Port 3003)
      ↓
  GraphRAG (Supabase)
      ↓
Shared Knowledge Base (17,697 resources)
      ↓
Coordinated Intelligence
```

### **How It Works:**

**Agent wants to work on something:**
1. Queries GraphRAG: "Has this been done?"
2. Checks MCP: "Is another agent working on this?"
3. Claims task via MCP
4. Does work
5. Updates GraphRAG with results
6. Completes task via MCP
7. **Other agents see the work immediately!**

**Result:** No duplication, full coordination

## 🎯 WHAT AGENTS IDENTIFIED AS GRAPHRAG PRIORITIES

**From coordination files:**

### **Top Priorities All Agents Agreed On:**

1. **"Populate GraphRAG with missing 1,219 files"** (Done! Now 17,697)
2. **"Feature 9 Gold Standard units prominently"** (In progress)
3. **"Organize 172 orphaned lessons into units"** (Identified)
4. **"Add relationship mapping to GraphRAG"** (383 connections mapped)
5. **"Enable GraphRAG as single source of truth"** (Happening!)

### **Agent-Specific GraphRAG Requests:**

**Agent-1 (Cultural):**
> "GraphRAG needs cultural concept taxonomy - map all Māori values"
- Status: ✅ Done! 24 concepts mapped

**Agent-3 (Content):**
> "Every new resource must be indexed to GraphRAG immediately"
- Status: ✅ Happening systematically

**Agent-5 (QA):**
> "GraphRAG should track quality scores for every resource"
- Status: ⏳ Can be added

**Agent-9 (Accessibility):**
> "GraphRAG needs WCAG compliance flags"
- Status: ⏳ Can be added

**Agent-12 (Documentation):**
> "All agent sessions should log to GraphRAG"
- Status: ⏳ MCP designed for this

## 🚀 CURRENT MCP + GRAPHRAG STATUS

### **MCP Servers:**
- ✅ 9 implementations created
- ⚠️ None currently running (no active server process)
- ✅ Configuration ready
- ✅ Supabase connection tested

### **GraphRAG:**
- ✅ 17,697 resources indexed (up from 217!)
- ✅ Growing rapidly (645% today)
- ✅ Working queries (search, filter, concepts)
- ✅ 24 cultural concepts mapped
- ✅ Relationship data collected (in JSON files)

### **Agent Coordination:**
- ⏳ Agents created coordination docs (140+ files!)
- ⏳ Many archived (context drift happened)
- ✅ Clear vision of what's needed
- ⏳ MCP server not currently running

---

## 💡 WHAT OTHER AGENTS WANT FROM GRAPHRAG

**From 140+ agent coordination documents:**

### **Consensus Vision:**
1. **Single Source of Truth** - All agents query GraphRAG first
2. **Prevent Context Drift** - MCP keeps everyone aligned
3. **No Duplicate Work** - Task claiming prevents overlap
4. **Shared Learning** - Knowledge added benefits all agents
5. **Strategic Coordination** - Collective decision-making

### **Specific Requests:**

**"Make GraphRAG queryable by natural language"** ✅ (Can do with Python scripts)

**"Add relationship graph visualization"** ⏳ (Need to implement)

**"Track which agent worked on which resource"** ✅ (Author field exists)

**"Enable cross-agent knowledge sharing"** ✅ (MCP designed for this)

**"Prevent agents working on same files"** ⏳ (Need active MCP server)

---

## 🎯 THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE CONNECTION

**Your insight:** "Map all 90k files → GraphRAG → Super intelligence"

**What agents said:** "GraphRAG as central brain enables coordination"

**These align perfectly!**

**With 100% mapping:**
- Agents query GraphRAG for anything
- Get instant architectural intelligence
- Make coordinated decisions
- Work on highest-value tasks
- **Collective super intelligence!** 🧠

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Option A: Continue Current Approach** (Working)
- Keep expanding GraphRAG (17,697 → 85,860)
- Use Python scripts for queries
- Manual coordination through docs
- **Pros:** Simple, working now
- **Cons:** No real-time multi-agent coordination

### **Option B: Activate MCP Server** (Next Level)
```bash
# Start GraphRAG-central MCP
node mcp-server-graphrag-central.js

# Now running on port 3003
# All agents can coordinate through it
```
**Pros:** Real-time coordination, prevents conflicts  
**Cons:** Need to test, ensure agents use it

### **Option C: Both in Parallel** (Recommended)
- Continue GraphRAG expansion (priority!)
- Run MCP server in background
- Agents use GraphRAG for intelligence
- MCP prevents coordination issues
- **Best of both worlds!**

---

## 📊 BOTTOM LINE

**MCP Infrastructure:** ✅ Built, ready to activate  
**GraphRAG Brain:** ✅ Growing rapidly (17,697 resources)  
**Agent Coordination:** ⏳ Through docs currently, MCP available  
**Super Intelligence Path:** ✅ Clear - map remaining 68,163 files  

**What agents want:** GraphRAG as single source of truth ✅  
**Your vision:** Complete mapping for super intelligence ✅  
**These align perfectly!** 🎯

**Continue mapping → Activate MCP → Achieve collective AI super intelligence!** 🚀
