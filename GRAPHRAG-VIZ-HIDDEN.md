# ✅ GraphRAG Knowledge Graph Visualization Hidden

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Issue:** GraphRAG knowledge graph visualization showing sitewide to end-users  
**Fix:** Added CSS rules to hide AI tooling from human interface  
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

---

## 🎯 **PROBLEM**

The GraphRAG knowledge graph visualization (`graphrag-knowledge-graph-viz`) was visible sitewide to end-users. This is an **AI tool for backend intelligence**, not a user-facing feature.

**User Impact:**
- Confusing for students and teachers
- Exposes backend AI infrastructure
- Clutters the user interface

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION**

Added comprehensive CSS rules to `/public/css/te-kete-professional.css`:

```css
/* =================================================================
   HIDE GRAPHRAG KNOWLEDGE GRAPH VISUALIZATION (AI Tool, Not for Users)
   ================================================================= */
#graphrag-knowledge-graph-container,
#graphrag-viz,
.tool-card[href*="graphrag-knowledge-graph"],
a[href*="graphrag-knowledge-graph"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```

**What This Hides:**
- ✅ The knowledge graph container (`#graphrag-knowledge-graph-container`)
- ✅ The D3.js visualization area (`#graphrag-viz`)
- ✅ Links to the knowledge graph component
- ✅ All references in tool directories

---

## 📂 **FILES AFFECTED**

**Modified:**
- `/public/css/te-kete-professional.css` (added 8 lines)

**Files with Hidden Content:**
- `/public/components/graphrag-knowledge-graph.html` (component still exists, just hidden)
- `/public/cultural-tools-directory.html` (link hidden via CSS)
- `/public/components/navigation-standard.html.bak` (backup file, no change needed)

---

## 🧠 **BACKEND STILL WORKS**

**Important:** The GraphRAG knowledge graph component is **not deleted**, just hidden from end-users!

**AI agents can still:**
- ✅ Access GraphRAG data via Supabase
- ✅ Query relationships and connections
- ✅ Use the intelligence layer for recommendations
- ✅ Navigate the knowledge graph programmatically

**Hidden from:**
- ❌ Students browsing lessons
- ❌ Teachers using the platform
- ❌ Casual visitors exploring content

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**

**Method:** CSS-only fix (no HTML changes needed)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Instant effect after cache clear
- ✅ No minified HTML to edit
- ✅ Easy to revert if needed
- ✅ Consistent with previous admin link hiding

**To Deploy:**
1. File already modified: `public/css/te-kete-professional.css`
2. Commit and push to trigger Netlify rebuild
3. Clear browser cache after deployment
4. Verify on live site

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

**After deployment, check:**
- [ ] Homepage: No knowledge graph visible
- [ ] Cultural tools directory: Link hidden
- [ ] Lesson pages: No graph containers
- [ ] Mobile view: Still hidden
- [ ] Browser console: No errors from hidden component

## 📊 **COORDINATION**

**Logged to:**
- ✅ This document
- ✅ Git commit message
- ⚠️ Will log to `agent_knowledge` after user confirms fix works

**Other Agents:**
- Claude previously hid admin navigation links (same strategy)
- This continues the pattern of CSS-based UI protection

**Status:** Ready for deployment  
**Risk:** LOW (CSS-only, easily reversible)  
**Impact:** HIGH (cleaner UX for end-users)
