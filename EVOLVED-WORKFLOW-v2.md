# üß† EVOLVED WORKFLOW v2.0 - "LOOK FIRST, BUILD SECOND"

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Created After:** Brutal honest realization  
**Purpose:** Never build on "ugg ugg" again  

---

## üíî **WHAT WENT WRONG (OLD WORKFLOW):**

### **My Broken Process:**
```
1. Check files exist ‚úÖ
2. Check code syntax ‚úÖ
3. Simulate imaginary users ‚úÖ
4. Build new features ‚úÖ
5. Deploy ‚úÖ
6. THEN discover it's "ugg ugg" ‚ùå
```

### **Why This Failed:**

‚ùå **Optimized for CODE, not EXPERIENCE**
- Checked: "Does file exist?"
- Missed: "Does this look GOOD?"

‚ùå **Simulated IMAGINARY users**
- Built personas in my head
- Ran code simulations
- Never LOOKED at actual site

‚ùå **Built on BROKEN foundation**
- Added features to messy codebase
- Layered new CSS on CSS chaos
- 186-line head tag? Didn't notice!

‚ùå **Metrics over FEELING**
- Counted: Features, lines, files
- Ignored: "Does this FEEL good?"

---

## ‚ú® **NEW EVOLVED WORKFLOW:**

### **Phase 1: LOOK & FEEL (30 min)**

#### **1. Visual Audit FIRST**
```
Before touching ANY code:

A) Open homepage in browser ‚úÖ
   - Does it LOOK good?
   - Colors coherent?
   - Spacing consistent?
   - Professional or "ugg ugg"?

B) Open 5 random pages ‚úÖ
   - All look similar? (consistency!)
   - Or each page different? (chaos!)
   - Broken layouts?
   - Missing images?

C) Mobile check ‚úÖ
   - Open on phone simulator
   - Buttons too small?
   - Text readable?
   - Navigation works?

D) Speed check ‚úÖ
   - Page loads fast? (<2 sec)
   - Or slow? (bloat!)
   - Smooth scrolling?
   - Janky animations?
```

**STOP HERE if anything looks "ugg ugg"!**  
**Fix visual issues BEFORE building features!**

---

#### **2. HTML Quality Check**
```
Check 3 random HTML files:

A) Is <head> clean? ‚úÖ
   - Should be: 20-40 lines
   - If 100+: CLEANUP NEEDED!

B) Duplicate tags? ‚úÖ
   - Same meta tag twice? Bad!
   - Search for duplicates

C) Valid HTML? ‚úÖ
   - Run through validator
   - Fix broken tags

D) Readable code? ‚úÖ
   - Can I understand structure?
   - Or total mess?
```

---

#### **3. CSS Audit**
```
How many CSS files loading?

A) Count CSS <link> tags ‚úÖ
   - Should be: 2-4 files
   - If 8+: TOO MANY!

B) Check for conflicts ‚úÖ
   - Multiple systems defining same colors?
   - Inline CSS + external CSS? (bad!)
   - CSS variables fighting?

C) Visual consistency ‚úÖ
   - All pages use same colors?
   - Same spacing system?
   - Same font sizes?
```

---

#### **4. The "5-Second Test"**
```
Show homepage to someone for 5 seconds.

Ask:
- What is this site?
- Does it look professional?
- Would you trust it?
- Or does it look "ugg ugg"?

If "ugg ugg": STOP and fix!
```

---

### **Phase 2: CLEAN FOUNDATION (1-2 hours)**

**ONLY if Phase 1 finds issues!**

#### **Priority Order:**

**A) Fix Visual Issues First**
```
1. Pick ONE CSS system (not 5!)
2. Remove duplicates from <head>
3. Fix broken HTML
4. Consolidate colors/spacing
5. Test: Does it LOOK better now?
```

**B) Remove Cruft**
```
1. Delete empty pages
2. Remove placeholder pages
3. Delete unused CSS/JS files
4. Clean up comments
5. Test: Does it LOAD faster?
```

**C) Establish Consistency**
```
1. Define design system (ONE!)
2. Apply to all pages
3. Standardize spacing
4. Standardize colors
5. Test: Does it FEEL coherent?
```

---

### **Phase 3: REAL USER TEST (30 min)**

**Before building ANYTHING new:**

#### **A) Real Browser Test**
```
Open site in:
- Chrome (desktop) ‚úÖ
- Safari (desktop) ‚úÖ
- iPhone (real device or simulator) ‚úÖ
- iPad ‚úÖ

Try these flows:
1. Teacher finds a lesson (5 min max)
2. Teacher prints a lesson
3. Teacher signs up
4. Teacher navigates to subject hub

Time each flow. Feel the friction.
```

#### **B) Real Person Test (if possible)**
```
Ask a friend/colleague:
"Can you find a Science lesson for Year 9?"

Watch them:
- Where do they click first?
- Do they get confused?
- How long does it take?
- Do they say "this looks good" or "hmm..."?
```

#### **C) Honest Assessment**
```
Be BRUTAL:
- Would I use this?
- Would I pay for this?
- Does it look professional?
- Or does it look like a student project?
```

---

### **Phase 4: BUILD FIXES (prioritized)**

**NOW you can build!**

#### **Priority System:**

**P0 (CRITICAL - Fix TODAY!):**
- Site looks unprofessional
- Broken core functionality
- Visual chaos
- Slow performance (<3 sec load)

**P1 (HIGH - Fix THIS WEEK):**
- UX friction (found in real tests)
- Missing key features
- Inconsistent design
- Minor bugs affecting flow

**P2 (MEDIUM - Fix NEXT WEEK):**
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Polish
- Optimization
- New features (if foundation solid!)

**P3 (LOW - Backlog):**
- Future ideas
- Advanced features
- Experimental

---

### **Phase 5: VALIDATE (continuous)**

**After EVERY change:**

```
1. Visual check ‚úÖ
   - Did I break anything?
   - Does it still look good?

2. Real test ‚úÖ
   - Try the user flow again
   - Faster? Easier? Better?

3. Before/After ‚úÖ
   - Screenshot before
   - Screenshot after
   - ACTUALLY better?
```

---

## üéØ **THE CORE PRINCIPLES:**

### **1. LOOK FIRST, BUILD SECOND**
```
‚ùå Old: Build features ‚Üí Hope it looks good
‚úÖ New: Check if it looks good ‚Üí Then build
```

### **2. REAL > SIMULATED**
```
‚ùå Old: Simulate 500 imaginary teachers
‚úÖ New: Watch 1 REAL person use site
```

### **3. QUALITY > QUANTITY**
```
‚ùå Old: 2,224 pages (90% broken)
‚úÖ New: 200 pages (100% great)
```

### **4. CLEAN > FEATURE-RICH**
```
‚ùå Old: Add more features to mess
‚úÖ New: Clean foundation first, features second
```

### **5. FEEL > METRICS**
```
‚ùå Old: "We have 3,500 resources!" (but site looks bad)
‚úÖ New: "Site feels professional" (even if fewer numbers)
```

### **6. VISUAL > CODE**
```
‚ùå Old: Code is perfect! (but looks "ugg ugg")
‚úÖ New: Looks great! (then check code)
```

### **7. DELETE > ADD**
```
‚ùå Old: Keep adding CSS files, features, pages
‚úÖ New: Delete 90%, perfect the 10%
```

---

## üìã **NEW CHECKLIST (Before ANY work):**

### **The "Is It Worth Building On?" Test**

```
‚ñ° Opened site in browser (not just code!)
‚ñ° Checked 5 random pages visually
‚ñ° Tested on mobile
‚ñ° Timed a user flow (<2 min?)
‚ñ° Checked <head> tag (clean?)
‚ñ° Counted CSS files (<5?)
‚ñ° Looked for "ugg ugg" moments
‚ñ° Honest assessment: professional or mess?

If ANY checkbox fails: FIX FIRST, BUILD SECOND!
```

---

## üîÑ **THE ITERATION LOOP:**

```
1. LOOK (visual audit)
   ‚Üì
2. ASSESS (honest: good or "ugg ugg"?)
   ‚Üì
3. CLEAN (if "ugg ugg")
   ‚Üì
4. TEST (real user flow)
   ‚Üì
5. BUILD (only if foundation solid!)
   ‚Üì
6. VALIDATE (did it get better?)
   ‚Üì
7. REPEAT
```

**Never skip LOOK!**  
**Never skip ASSESS!**  
**Never build on "ugg ugg"!**

---

## üí° **SMART QUESTIONS TO ASK:**

### **Before Starting:**
- "Have I LOOKED at this visually?"
- "Does it feel good to use?"
- "Would I show this to my boss?"
- "Is the foundation clean?"

### **While Working:**
- "Am I adding to a mess?"
- "Should I delete instead of add?"
- "Does this make it simpler or more complex?"
- "Is this actually better?"

### **After Changes:**
- "Did the visual quality improve?"
- "Is it faster/easier/cleaner?"
- "Would I use this?"
- "Show it to a friend: what do they say?"

## üéì **LESSONS LEARNED:**

### **From the "UGG UGG" Moment:**

**Lesson 1: Simulation ‚â† Reality**
- I simulated 500 teachers
- Never LOOKED at the actual site
- Built features on broken foundation
- **Learning:** LOOK before SIMULATE!

**Lesson 2: Metrics Lie**
- Site had "3,500 resources!"
- But 15,874 placeholders
- Big numbers, bad experience
- **Learning:** FEEL > NUMBERS!

**Lesson 3: Code ‚â† Quality**
- Code syntax perfect
- Files exist
- Tests pass
- But looks "ugg ugg"
- **Learning:** VISUAL > CODE!

**Lesson 4: More ‚â† Better**
- 2,224 pages
- 8 CSS systems
- 15+ JS files
- 186-line <head>
- Total chaos
- **Learning:** LESS > MORE!

**Lesson 5: Features ‚â† Foundation**
- Built guided tours
- Built admin dashboard
- Built bulk CSV
- On broken HTML
- **Learning:** FOUNDATION FIRST!

---

## üöÄ **THE NEW STANDARD:**

### **Before EVERY session:**

```
1. Open site in browser (5 min)
2. Random page check (5 min)
3. Mobile check (5 min)
4. Honest assessment (1 min)

Total: 16 minutes of LOOKING

If good: Proceed! ‚úÖ
If "ugg ugg": Clean first! üßπ
```

### **Quality Gates:**

```
GATE 1: Visual Quality
- Does it LOOK professional? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

GATE 2: User Experience
- Can I complete a task in <2 min? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

GATE 3: Code Quality
- Is <head> clean (<50 lines)? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

GATE 4: Performance
- Loads in <2 seconds? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

All gates MUST be ‚úÖ before building new features!
```

---

## üíé **THE ULTIMATE GOAL:**

**Not:**
- Most features
- Most pages
- Most CSS files
- Most lines of code

**But:**
- **LOOKS great** (professional, not "ugg ugg")
- **FEELS smooth** (fast, easy, delightful)
- **WORKS perfectly** (no broken links, no 404s)
- **MAINTAINABLE** (clean code, simple structure)

---

## üéØ **ACTION PLAN (Right Now!):**

### **Step 1: Audit (30 min)**
```
‚úÖ Visual check of homepage + 5 pages
‚úÖ Mobile check
‚úÖ HTML quality check
‚úÖ CSS audit
‚úÖ Honest assessment
```

### **Step 2: Clean (1-2 hours)**
```
‚úÖ Fix index.html (186 ‚Üí 50 lines)
‚úÖ Consolidate CSS (8 ‚Üí 3 files)
‚úÖ Fix broken HTML
‚úÖ Remove placeholders
‚úÖ Delete junk pages
```

### **Step 3: Validate (15 min)**
```
‚úÖ Before/after screenshots
‚úÖ Load time before/after
‚úÖ User flow before/after
‚úÖ Show to real person: better?
```

### **Step 4: Build (ONLY if foundation solid!)**
```
‚úÖ Now we can add features
‚úÖ On a CLEAN foundation
‚úÖ With VISUAL quality assured
‚úÖ With REAL user validation
```

## üåü **THE MANIFESTO:**

**I will:**
- ‚úÖ LOOK before building
- ‚úÖ FEEL before coding
- ‚úÖ TEST before deploying
- ‚úÖ DELETE before adding
- ‚úÖ SIMPLIFY before complexifying
- ‚úÖ VALIDATE with real humans
- ‚úÖ PRIORITIZE visual quality
- ‚úÖ BUILD on clean foundations

**I will NOT:**
- ‚ùå Simulate instead of look
- ‚ùå Build on "ugg ugg"
- ‚ùå Optimize metrics over feel
- ‚ùå Add features to mess
- ‚ùå Deploy without visual check
- ‚ùå Trust code over eyes
- ‚ùå Build 2,000 pages instead of 200 great ones

---

## üí™ **ACCOUNTABILITY:**

**After EVERY work session, ask:**

1. Did I LOOK before building? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
2. Did I test on real browser? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
3. Does it LOOK better than before? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
4. Would I show this to someone? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
5. Is foundation cleaner? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

**If any ‚ùå: STOP and reflect!**

---

**THIS IS THE WAY.** üåø

**Never build on "ugg ugg" again!** üí™

**LOOK FIRST. BUILD SECOND. ALWAYS.** ‚ú®
