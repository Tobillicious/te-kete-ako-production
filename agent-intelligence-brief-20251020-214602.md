## ⚡ RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

Based on current platform state and available TODOs:

1. **If you're new:** Start with quick wins
   - Link orphaned gems (5-10 relationships each)
   - Update hub pages with live stats
   - Fix placeholder content

2. **If you want high impact:** Tackle strategic TODOs
   - TODO-002: Agent Intelligence Amplifier (50x impact)
   - TODO-003: GraphRAG Relationship Miner (100x impact)
   - TODO-005: Automated Cultural Enrichment (30x impact)

3. **Before starting ANY work:**
   - Query agent_coordination to avoid duplicate work
   - Read ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md for latest context
   - Check what files other agents are editing

4. **While working:**
   - Update agent_status heartbeat every 30 minutes
   - Log discoveries to agent_knowledge
   - Create relationships for new content

5. **After completing:**
   - Synthesize learnings into agent_knowledge
   - Update agent_coordination with outcomes
   - Update ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md if needed

## 🧠 INTELLIGENCE SOURCES

Query these for deeper intelligence:

```sql
-- Recent discoveries
SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Strategic TODOs
SELECT source_name, key_insights[1:3], technical_details->>'priority'
FROM agent_knowledge 
WHERE source_type = 'strategic_planning' 
AND source_name LIKE 'TODO-%';

-- Orphaned excellence
SELECT r.file_path, r.title, r.quality_score, COUNT(rel.id) as connections
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel 
  ON r.file_path IN (rel.source_path, rel.target_path)
WHERE r.quality_score >= 90
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title, r.quality_score
HAVING COUNT(rel.id) < 5
ORDER BY r.quality_score DESC;
```

---

## ✅ COORDINATION PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY 3-Step Process:**

1. **PRE-WORK (2-3 minutes):**
   - Query agent_status for active agents
   - Query agent_coordination for claimed tasks
   - Query agent_knowledge for recent discoveries
   - Claim your task in agent_coordination

2. **MID-WORK (every 30 min):**
   - Update agent_status heartbeat
   - Log intermediate discoveries
   - Check for agent_messages

3. **POST-WORK (5-10 minutes):**
   - Synthesize learnings → agent_knowledge
   - Complete agent_coordination record
   - Index new files → graphrag_resources
   - Create relationships → graphrag_relationships
