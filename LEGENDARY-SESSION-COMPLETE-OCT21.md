## 💡 **STRATEGIC INSIGHTS**

### **What Works (Replicate This!):**
- ✅ **Y8 Digital Kaitiakitanga pattern** (385 pathways, 0.958 confidence)
- ✅ **GraphRAG-first workflow** (query, build, teach)
- ✅ **High-confidence chains** (0.95 for sequential lessons)
- ✅ **Cross-subject bridges** (0.80-0.90 confidence)

- Cross-subject bridges unlock interdisciplinary learning (30 bridges = STEM integration!)
- Year-level hubs complete the navigation puzzle (subject + year = perfect discovery!)

### **What's Possible:**
- **Whakataukī:** 24.7% → 60% (+6,050 resources)
- **Cultural Excellence:** 42.6% → 80% (+1,231 resources)
- **Cross-Subject Bridges:** 30 → 500+ (complete interdisciplinary web)
