## 📋 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **To Activate This Intelligence:**

**1. Execute SQL** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Open Supabase SQL editor
# Run: backend-intelligence-deployment.sql
# Verify: Views and functions created
```

**2. Test Intelligence** (10 minutes)
```sql
-- Test collections
SELECT * FROM intelligent_collections LIMIT 10;

-- Test semantic search
SELECT * FROM semantic_search('mathematics māori', true, true, 20);

-- Test recommendations
SELECT calculate_recommendation_score('uuid1'::uuid, 'uuid2'::uuid);

-- Test predictions
SELECT * FROM teacher_dashboard_intelligence;
```

**3. Integrate Frontend** (2 hours)
- Update search to use `semantic_search()` function
- Add "Recommended for you" using recommendation engine
- Show intelligent collections on homepage
- Display learning pathways

**4. Monitor Intelligence** (ongoing)
- Track which collections teachers use
- Measure recommendation click-through
- Refine based on usage patterns
