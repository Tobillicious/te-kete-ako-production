## ⚙️ **AUTOMATION APPROACH:**

Since terminal commands hang, manual fixes required for:
1. Read file to understand structure
2. Apply standard CSS/JS includes after ultimate-beauty-system
3. Verify no duplicates
4. Test sample pages

**Pattern to find:**
```bash
grep -l "te-kete-ultimate-beauty-system.css" public/*.html | \
xargs grep -L "main.css"
```

**Pattern to fix:**
- Find: `<!-- END ULTIMATE BEAUTY SYSTEM -->`
- Check if next lines have main.css
- If not, insert standard includes
