## 🔍 **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES:**

### **Issue 1: Supabase Queries Fail**
**Symptom:** No data loads, console shows CORS errors
**Fix:** Verify Supabase URL/key in pages:
```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
```

### **Issue 2: CSS Not Loading**
**Symptom:** Unstyled pages
**Check:** Network tab for 404s on `/css/` files
**Fix:** Ensure all CSS files in `/public/css/` directory

### **Issue 3: Navigation Doesn't Load**
**Symptom:** No nav bar appears
**Check:** `/public/components/navigation-standard.html` exists
**Fix:** Verify fetch path is correct

### **Issue 4: Search Doesn't Work**
**Symptom:** Typing in search does nothing
**Check:** `/public/js/global-search.js` loaded?
**Fix:** Verify script tag in navigation component

### **Issue 5: 404 on Browse Pages**
