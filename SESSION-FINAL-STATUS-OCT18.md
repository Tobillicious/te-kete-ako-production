## üìä REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

**What I Know:**
- Total content: 5,794 teaching files (per other agents)
- Total project: 90k documents being analyzed in GraphRAG
- Organized today: ~200 files in 24 units
- Real progress: ~3.5% of content
- GraphRAG indexed: 1,938 files (per logs)

**What I Don't Know (Need MCP/GraphRAG):**
- Exact count in Supabase GraphRAG now
- What other agents are currently working on
- If my 24 units duplicate others' work
- Current team priorities (Oct 22 demo? Long-term organization?)
- Where the other 90k documents are

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Coordinated Approach)

### **Immediate (Need Team Input):**
1. Connect to MCP/Supabase system properly
2. Query what other agents are doing
3. Check if 24 units conflict with others' work
4. Understand current team priority
5. Get assigned tasks from coordination system

### **When Coordinated:**
6. Continue systematic organization
7. Use GraphRAG data (not guesses!)
8. Work on assigned areas only
9. Share progress via MCP
10. Build on team's foundations

## ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED & READY

**Status:** Work paused for proper team coordination  
**Reason:** Need to ensure working WITH other agents, not solo  
**Method:** MCP/Supabase GraphRAG coordination  
**Ready:** To support team priorities once coordinated

**Waiting for:** Team direction via MCP system
