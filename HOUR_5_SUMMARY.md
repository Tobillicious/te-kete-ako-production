## 🎯 STRATEGIC DECISION - TE REO MĀORI:

**Consideration:** Should we create an 8th standalone curriculum page for Te Reo Māori?

**Analysis:**
- Te Reo Māori is **integrated throughout all 7 curriculum pages** already
- Every subject includes Māori language, cultural context, and tikanga
- Mātauranga Māori is embedded in Science, Social Sciences, Arts, Technology
- We have dedicated cultural resources (kapa haka, whakataukī, pūrākau)

**Recommendation:** 
✅ **SKIP standalone Te Reo page** - our integration model is stronger
✅ **FOCUS on performance optimization & testing** - more valuable for Oct 22 demo

**Alternative:** Could create a "Te Reo Māori & Cultural Resources Hub" later if needed
