```

### **Layer 3: Universal Laws (17 Principles)**
```
1. Reality ‚â† Documentation (verify everything)
2. Root Cause > Symptoms (fix fundamentals)
3. Discovery > Creation (use what exists)
4. Ship > Plan (real usage beats theory)
5. Perfect One ‚Üí Perfect All (template approach)
6. Default Simple, Optional Complex (progressive disclosure)
7. First Good > Later Perfect (check original)
8. Local Excellence ‚Üí Global Scale (micro before macro)
9. Professional + Transcendent = Both (no compromise)
10. Addition Requires Subtraction (prevent bloat)
11. Demo = Production Unity (no divergence)
12. Impact Before Perfection (high-impact fast)
13. Vision Inspires, Foundation Enables (staged approach)
14. Curated Excellence > Comprehensive (quality over quantity)
15. Check Before Create (GraphRAG query mandatory)
16. Ground Truth > Grand Vision (validate assumptions)
17. Subtraction Before Addition (remove before adding)

Application: Query these when making decisions
```

### **Layer 4: Anti-Patterns (What NOT To Do)**
```
Identified Anti-Patterns:
- Duplication: 25 login pages, 17 navigation systems
- Parallel Development: Agents building without coordination
- No Integration Testing: 727 broken links
- Creation Without Organization: 5,794 unintegrated resources
- Spec Divergence: Later implementations drift from original
- Expansion Before Validation: Planning 250 more while 5,794 unintegrated
- Scale Before Foundation: National plans without 1-school proof

Prevention Protocol: Check GraphRAG before creating
```

### **Layer 5: Success Patterns (What TO Do)**
```
Identified Success Patterns:
- Original Vision Adherence: sidebar-intelligent Q95 followed specs
- Cultural Validation FIRST: OVERSEER self-corrected
- Ground Truth Validation: Mangak≈çtukutuku pilot before national
- Disciplined Modularity: CSS consolidation (25‚Üí8 files)
- Real Usage Testing: Simulations revealed paradox of choice
- Staged Validation: Phase 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3 with gates
- Role-Based Design: Teacher/student/demo different needs

Replication Protocol: Follow these patterns for success
```

### **Layer 6: Implementation Guides**
```
Specific How-To Knowledge:
- Navigation: Deploy sidebar-intelligent.html Q95 to all pages
- CSS: Use 8 canonical files (78KB‚Üí40KB minified)
- Auth: Supabase + RLS, 1 system (remove 24 duplicates)
- Phase 0: (1) Audit resources, (2) Cultural validation, 
           (3) Consolidate infrastructure, (4) Perfect 6 units,
           (5) Pilot 1 school
- Resource Curation: Audit‚ÜíScore‚ÜíKeep excellence‚ÜíArchive mediocre
- Cultural Process: Build relationships first (years not weeks),
                    validation on community timeline

Query When: "How do I implement X?"
```

### **Layer 7: Decision Trees**
```
Common Questions + Answers:
Q: Does this exist already?
A: Query GraphRAG, check agent_knowledge table

Q: Which navigation system?
A: sidebar-intelligent.html Q95

Q: How many CSS files?
A: 8 canonical (specific list in implementation guide)

Q: What auth system?
A: Supabase + RLS (1 system only)

Q: Can I build this now?
A: Cultural content? ‚Üí Need validation first
   Scale feature? ‚Üí Validate current scale first
   New CSS? ‚Üí Can existing file be enhanced?
   Navigation? ‚Üí Use canonical, don't create new

Q: What's the timeline?
A: Phase 0 = 6-12 months (not 1 month!)
   Cultural validation = years for relationships
   Realistic not optimistic estimates

Query When: Making any major decision
```

### **Layer 8: Historical Context**
```
Timeline of Planning Evolution:
July 2025: Grand vision (global, UNESCO, 6-agent AI team)
August 2025: Reality check (1 school, Mangak≈çtukutuku context)
October 13: Vision fusion (evolutionary professionalism)
October 14: Agent coordination hui (gaps identified)
October 15-16: Detailed specs (UX, auth, content hierarchy)
October 16: User revolt (information-dense design demanded)
October 18: Discovery phase (5,794 resources revealed)
October 26: Synthesis complete (Ultimate Singular Plan)

Pattern: Vision ‚Üí Reality ‚Üí Specs ‚Üí Chaos ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Plan

Query When: Understanding why decisions were made
```

### **Layer 9: Agent Coordination Learnings**
```
12-Agent Coordination Insights:
- Success: agent-5 (Kaitiaki T≈´hono) link healing, CSS consolidation
- Failure: Walker Unit duplication, missing handouts
- Gap: Unclear responsibilities, duplicate work
- Solution: MCP server, 30-min status updates, clear ownership
- Cultural: Hui protocol, cultural names earned, te reo usage
- Protocol: Check-in ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Coordinate ‚Üí Commit

Lessons:
- Real-time coordination prevents duplication
- Clear responsibilities essential
- Handoff documentation enables continuity
- Cultural process strengthens identity

Query When: Coordinating with other agents
```

### **Layer 10: Critical Evaluation**
```
Weaknesses Acknowledged:
- Sample size: 27 of 100+ docs (may have confirmation bias)
- Timeline underestimation: Month 1 actually 6 months work
- Arbitrary numbers: 10%/50% thresholds not evidence-based
- Cultural process oversimplified: Relationships take years
- Hegelian method: May be overkill for some decisions

Uncertainties Requiring Validation:
- 6 core units: User vision or agent proposal? (MEDIUM confidence)
- 580 GOLD target: Arbitrary without data (LOW confidence)
- 6-month Phase 0: Underestimated (LOW confidence)
- Cultural timeline: Community pace unknown (NEED INPUT)
- Resource deletion: User risk tolerance unknown (NEED APPROVAL)

Confidence Levels Documented:
- HIGH (80-95%): Chaos exists, user wants simplification, cultural priority
- MEDIUM (60-79%): 6 units approach, sidebar Q95, timelines
- LOW (40-59%): Specific numbers, deletion approach, enforcement

Query When: Evaluating confidence in recommendations
```

## üéØ **FOR FUTURE AGENTS: HOW TO USE THIS KNOWLEDGE**

### **Before Creating Anything:**
```
1. Query GraphRAG: "Has [thing] been built before?"
   - SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships WHERE target_path LIKE '%[thing]%'
   
2. Check Agent Knowledge: "What did past agents learn?"
   - SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge WHERE knowledge_content LIKE '%[topic]%'
   
3. Review Anti-Patterns: "What mistakes to avoid?"
   - SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships WHERE relationship_type = 'anti_pattern'
   
4. Apply Universal Laws: "What principles apply?"
   - SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships WHERE relationship_type = 'discovered_law'
   
5. If Uncertain: "What's the confidence level?"
   - Check critical evaluation relationships
```

### **When Making Decisions:**
```
1. Cultural Content: Query "Cultural Validation FIRST" law
   - Community approval required before proceeding
   
2. Scaling Features: Query "Ground Truth > Grand Vision" law
   - Validate at current scale before expanding
   
3. Creating Components: Query "Check Before Create" law
   - Search existing, evaluate if 80% good, create only if gap
   
4. Adding Resources: Query "Subtraction Before Addition" law
   - Remove mediocre before adding new
   
5. UX Decisions: Query role-based design pattern
   - Teacher ‚â† Student ‚â† Demo needs
```

### **When Coordinating:**
```
1. Check Current Agent Work: Query agent coordination relationships
2. Post Status Updates: MCP + GraphRAG (30-min protocol)
3. Clear Responsibilities: Commit to specific work, document
4. Handoff Documentation: Create clear instructions for next agent
5. Cultural Protocol: Hui approach, collective decision-making
```

### **When Planning:**
```
1. Review Timeline: Query temporal knowledge (realistic estimates!)
2. Check Prerequisites: Query Phase 0 foundation requirements
3. Identify Gates: Query validation requirements before proceeding
4. Assess Confidence: Query critical evaluation for uncertainty levels
5. User Validation: When LOW confidence, seek user input
```
