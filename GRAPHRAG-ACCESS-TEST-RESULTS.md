# üß™ GRAPHRAG/MCP ACCESS TEST RESULTS

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Agent:** Kaitiaki Aronui V3.0  
**Purpose:** Verify proper GraphRAG access using correct tools

---

## üéØ UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM:

### **The Proper Architecture:**

**READ Access** (All 12 Agents):
- Uses: `anon` key directly
- Tables: `graphrag_resources`, `graphrag_relationships`, `agent_knowledge`
- Status: ‚úÖ **WORKING** (verified by multiple agents)
- Method: Direct Supabase client

**WRITE Access** (All 12 Agents):
- Uses: `SupabaseGraphRAGConnector` class
- Key: `service_role` (bypasses RLS)
- Tables: All GraphRAG tables
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
- Method: Connector wrapper with service_role key

---

## üìã TESTS TO RUN:

### **Test 1: Comprehensive Access Test**
```bash
python3 test-graphrag-proper.py
```

**Expected Results:**
```
‚úÖ graphrag_resources READ: WORKING
‚úÖ agent_knowledge READ: WORKING
‚úÖ Total resources in GraphRAG: 13,772 (or similar)
‚úÖ Connector connection: Connected! X resources in GraphRAG
‚úÖ Connector search: WORKING
‚úÖ Connector WRITE: WORKING (or fallback to local logging)
```

### **Test 2: Full Onboarding**
```bash
python3 agent-onboard-now.py
```

**Expected Results:**
```
‚úÖ Platform Resources: 13,772
‚úÖ Total Relationships: 238,600
‚úÖ Cultural Integration: 55.2%
‚úÖ Excellence (Q90+): 5,379
Recent discoveries listed
Session logged
```

### **Test 3: Intelligence Brief**
```bash
python3 scripts/agent-intelligence-amplifier.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- Platform state summary
- Recent agent discoveries
- Successful patterns
- Failed attempts
- Current priorities
- Orphaned gems
- Super-hubs
- Recommendations

## üîç WHAT EACH TEST REVEALS:

### **If READ Works But WRITE Blocked:**

**Symptoms:**
```
‚úÖ graphrag_resources READ: WORKING
‚ùå Connector WRITE: FAILED - row-level security policy
```

**Meaning:**
- Multi-agent access fix NOT yet applied
- Agents can query but not contribute
- Need to run: `COMPLETE-MULTI-AGENT-FIX.sql` in Supabase Dashboard

**Fix:**
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq/sql
2. Copy: Contents of `COMPLETE-MULTI-AGENT-FIX.sql`
3. Paste and Run
4. Retest

---

### **If Both READ and WRITE Work:**

**Symptoms:**
```
‚úÖ graphrag_resources READ: WORKING
‚úÖ Connector WRITE: WORKING
```

**Meaning:**
- Multi-agent access is FULLY OPERATIONAL!
- All 12 agents can collaborate
- GraphRAG knowledge sharing working
- No fix needed

---

### **If Connector Uses Fallback:**

**Symptoms:**
```
‚úÖ graphrag_resources READ: WORKING
‚ö†Ô∏è  Connector WRITE: Fallback to local logging
```

**Meaning:**
- READ works fine
- WRITE blocked by RLS
- Connector gracefully falls back to local files
- Multi-agent collaboration limited

**This is the CURRENT STATE based on docs**

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULTS:

### **Scenario A: All Tests Pass ‚úÖ**
‚Üí Multi-agent collaboration ready!
‚Üí Move to TODO #8: Testing & Deployment
‚Üí No fix needed

### **Scenario B: READ works, WRITE blocked ‚ö†Ô∏è**
‚Üí Need to apply multi-agent fix
‚Üí Run COMPLETE-MULTI-AGENT-FIX.sql in Supabase
‚Üí Then move to testing

### **Scenario C: Connection issues ‚ùå**
‚Üí Check API keys
‚Üí Verify Supabase project is accessible
‚Üí Test network connection

---

## üìñ HOW TO RUN TESTS:

### **Quick Test (30 seconds):**
```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean
python3 test-graphrag-proper.py
```

### **Full Suite (2 minutes):**
```bash
chmod +x run-all-tests.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
```

### **Just Intelligence Brief:**
```bash
python3 scripts/agent-intelligence-amplifier.py
```

---

## üéØ WHAT WE'LL LEARN:

1. **Can agents READ GraphRAG?** (Expected: YES ‚úÖ)
2. **Can agents WRITE to GraphRAG?** (Expected: DEPENDS on RLS fix)
3. **What's the platform state?** (Expected: 13,772 resources, 55.2% cultural)
4. **What are current priorities?** (From recent agent discoveries)
5. **What have agents learned recently?** (From agent_knowledge)

---

## üß∫ EXPECTED FINDINGS (Based on Docs):

**Platform State:**
- 13,772 educational resources
- 238,600 relationships  
- 55.2% cultural integration
- 5,379 excellence resources (Q90+)
- 99% production ready

**Recent Discoveries:**
- Platform is EXCELLENT, not broken
- "Missing includes" and "orphaned pages" debunked
- Real priorities: Testing, deployment, refinement

**Current Agent Work:**
- Multiple sessions complete
- GraphRAG intelligence tools operational
- Coordination via ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md

**Status:** Tests created and ready to run!

**Run:** `python3 test-graphrag-proper.py` to see current state! üöÄ
