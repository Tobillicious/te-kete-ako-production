## 🔍 How GraphRAG Works

### **Traditional Search:**
```
Search: "genetics"
Results: keyword match only
```

### **GraphRAG Search:**
```
Query: "genetics"
GraphRAG analyzes:
  ├─ Subject connections (Biology, Science)
  ├─ Cultural elements (Whakapapa concept)
  ├─ Year level progressions (9-13)
  ├─ Prerequisite knowledge
  └─ Related cultural resources

Results: Intelligent recommendations including:
  ✓ Genetics & Whakapapa (cultural connection)
  ✓ DNA Science lessons
  ✓ Biotechnology ethics through Māori worldview
  ✓ Traditional knowledge systems
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema:**

**graphrag_resources table:**
```sql
- file_path (unique identifier)
- title, resource_type, subject
- quality_score (0-100)
- cultural_context (boolean)
- has_whakataukī, has_te_reo (boolean)
- year_level, metadata (jsonb)
```

**graphrag_relationships table:**
```sql
- source_path, target_path
- relationship_type
- confidence (0.0-1.0)
- metadata (jsonb)
```

### **Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  r.file_path,
  r.title,
  r.quality_score,
  r.cultural_context,
  COUNT(rel.id) as connections
FROM graphrag_resources r
LEFT JOIN graphrag_relationships rel 
  ON r.file_path = rel.source_path
WHERE 
  r.subject ILIKE '%science%'
  AND r.cultural_context = true
  AND r.quality_score >= 90
GROUP BY r.file_path, r.title
ORDER BY r.quality_score DESC, connections DESC;
```
