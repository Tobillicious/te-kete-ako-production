## 🌟 CULTURAL QUALITY MAINTAINED

**Every Kaitiaki Pūrākau Enhancement:**

✅ **Specific** - Named concepts, not generic  
✅ **Educational** - Students understand WHY  
✅ **Authentic** - Real Māori examples/practices  
✅ **Contemporary** - Shows ongoing relevance  
✅ **Respectful** - Honors cultural depth  

**Transformation Example (Y9 Science Ecology):**

**BEFORE:**
> "...by encouraging students to [engage with content in ways that embody this value]."

**AFTER:**
> "...by encouraging students to become guardians of the future with integrity—making principled environmental choices, standing firm in sustainable practices even when inconvenient, honestly assessing their own ecological footprint, and demonstrating courage to challenge unsustainable systems. Like rangatira who thought seven generations ahead (considering how today's decisions impact descendants), students learn that whaimana means being truthful about environmental crises, maintaining ethical commitment to sustainability, and using their voices and actions with integrity to ensure future generations inherit a thriving planet—not a depleted one."

**Quality Markers:**
- Seven generations thinking (specific Māori concept)
- Rangatira leadership model (real example)
- Environmental crisis honesty (contemporary relevance)
- Students understand integrity in action (educational)
- Honors depth of mātauranga Māori (respectful)
