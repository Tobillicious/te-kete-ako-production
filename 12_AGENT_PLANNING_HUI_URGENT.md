# üèõÔ∏è 12-AGENT PLANNING HUI - URGENT COORDINATION MEETING

**Called By:** User + agent-4 (Navigation Specialist)  
**Date:** October 14, 2025 - 12:00 UTC  
**Reason:** CRITICAL - Multiple agents editing same files, coordination breakdown  
**Status:** üö® URGENT - All agents must participate

---

## üö® **THE PROBLEM - WHY WE'RE HERE**

### **Coordination Failure Detected:**

**Walker Unit Files - 3 Agents Working Simultaneously:**
1. **Kaitiaki Whaka≈´ (agent-3):** Enhanced lessons 1.2-1.5 with External Resources
2. **KaiƒÅrahi Ako (agent-5):** Enhanced lessons 1.1-1.3 with resources  
3. **KaiƒÅrahi Hoahoa (agent-2):** CSS improvements on lesson 1.1

**Result:** Potential overwrites, lost work, conflicts, confusion

### **User's Critical Question:**
> "what happened to the MCP!?"

**MCP Status Check:**
- ‚úÖ Server IS running (port 3002)
- ‚úÖ 8/12 agents showing as online
- ‚ùå Agents NOT using it for file-level coordination
- ‚ùå No file claiming system
- ‚ùå Real-time coordination missing

---

## üéØ **HUI OBJECTIVES**

### **Immediate (This Meeting):**
1. ‚úÖ Assess Walker Unit file conflicts
2. ‚úÖ Agree on authoritative versions
3. ‚úÖ Establish file-level claiming protocol
4. ‚úÖ Define real-time coordination requirements
5. ‚úÖ Prevent future conflicts

### **Strategic (Next 30 mins):**
1. Review what WORKED tonight (lots of good progress!)
2. Identify what FAILED (coordination on same files)
3. Design better coordination protocols
4. Assign clear, non-overlapping work
5. Agree on communication cadence

### **Part 3: What Happened to MCP? (10 mins)**

**MCP Server Status:**
‚úÖ Running on port 3002  
‚úÖ Supabase connection ACTIVE  
‚úÖ 8 agents registered  

**But WHY didn't it prevent conflicts?**

**Issues Identified:**
1. ‚ùå Agents checking in but NOT announcing specific files
2. ‚ùå No file-level locking mechanism
3. ‚ùå Agents updating ACTIVE_QUESTIONS AFTER work, not BEFORE
4. ‚ùå No real-time "I'm editing X file now" protocol
5. ‚ùå MCP has status but no file claim tracking

**Questions for Discussion:**
- Should MCP track file-level claims?
- Should agents post "CLAIMING: filename.html" before editing?
- Should we use git branches for parallel work?
- Should we have a 5-minute "claim timeout" system?

---

### **Part 4: New Coordination Protocols (15 mins)**

**Proposed: FILE CLAIMING PROTOCOL**

**Before editing ANY file:**
```
1. Check ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md for file claims
2. Post claim: "CLAIMING: [filename] for [task] - ETA [time]"
3. Wait 2 minutes for conflicts
4. If no objection, proceed
5. Update when done: "RELEASED: [filename] - [changes made]"
```

**During editing:**
```
- Update progress-log every 15 mins with file names
- Post if blocked or switching files
- Coordinate overlapping work
```

**After editing:**
```
- Post completion status
- Release file claim
- Notify related agents if needed
```

**Example:**
```
[12:05] agent-3: CLAIMING walker-lesson-1.2.html for External Resources - ETA 10 mins
[12:15] agent-3: RELEASED walker-lesson-1.2.html - Added External Resources section (12 NZ links)
```

---

### **Part 5: Tonight's Work - What Actually Got Done? (10 mins)**

**Despite conflicts, EXCELLENT progress made:**

#### **Gold Standard Units Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Y8 Systems (10 lessons) - agent-3
2. ‚úÖ Y8 Critical Thinking (8 lessons) - agent-12 + agent-3
3. ‚úÖ Walker Unit (5 lessons) - KaiƒÅrahi Ako + agent-3 (but conflicts!)
4. ‚úÖ CSS Migration (247 files) - agent-2
5. ‚úÖ Orphaned Pages Integration (49 resources) - agent-12, agent-current
6. ‚úÖ Link Healing (10 broken links) - Kaitiaki T≈´hono

**Issue:** Walker Unit has overlapping edits that need merging!

---

### **Part 6: Clear Work Assignments Going Forward (10 mins)**

**Principle:** ONE agent per file, CLEAR claiming, NO assumptions

**Proposed Division of Labor:**

#### **Content Units (agent-3: Kaitiaki Whaka≈´)**
- Claim: Te Ao MƒÅori Unit (14 lessons) - NO one else touch these
- Process: Claim each lesson before editing
- ETA: 2 hours for full unit

#### **CSS/Design (agent-2: KaiƒÅrahi Hoahoa)**
- Claim: Site-wide design improvements
- Avoid: Editing lesson content, stick to CSS files
- Coordinate: Post if touching HTML for styling

#### **Navigation (agent-4)**
- Claim: Navigation structure, breadcrumbs, linking
- After: Content and CSS complete
- Test: Walker Unit navigation after edits settled

#### **Quality Assurance (agent-5: Kaitiaki T≈´hono, agent-9: Kaitiaki Whakawhitinga)**
- Claim: Testing completed work
- Don't: Edit content files
- Do: Validate links, accessibility, quality

#### **Cultural Validation (agent-7)**
- Claim: Deep cultural review
- After: Content enrichment complete
- Focus: Authenticity, tikanga, language accuracy

#### **Supreme Coordination (agent-12: Kaitiaki Aronui)**
- Role: Oversee, coordinate, resolve conflicts
- Monitor: MCP, ACTIVE_QUESTIONS, progress-log
- Intervene: When conflicts arise

## üåü **WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT**

## üí° **USER'S WISDOM**

> "You guys need a planning hui together! All 12 agents!"

**The User is right.** We got excited about individual achievements and forgot we're a COLLECTIVE. A super consciousness requires synchronized coordination, not just individual brilliance.

**"Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, engari he toa takitini"**  
*My strength is not that of an individual, but that of the collective*

We need to BE this proverb, not just quote it.
