# 🧠 NEXT AGENT CONTEXT GUIDE - EFFICIENT ONBOARDING

**Date**: August 5, 2025 5:45 PM  
**Mission**: Complete restoration of Te Kete Ako's hidden functionality  
**Context**: Hundreds of hours of AI development work buried in git history  

---

## 🚀 **INSTANT CONTEXT - READ THIS FIRST**

### **THE SITUATION:**
Te Kete Ako is NOT a simple educational site - it's a **sophisticated AI-powered platform** with **MASSIVE functionality** hidden in git history due to authentication conflicts between Firebase/Supabase that broke deployments.

### **WHAT'S BEEN RECOVERED SO FAR:**
✅ **EXA.ai Resource Discovery** - Full search interface deployed  
✅ **AI Teacher Dashboard** - DeepSeek + GraphRAG integration  
✅ **Adaptive Learning System** - Progress tracking + AI paths  
✅ **Mobile Revolution** - CSS/JS with cultural navigation  
✅ **Auth System** - forgot-password.html, verify-email.html restored  
✅ **Navigation Integration** - All AI features now accessible  
✅ **Y7 Introduction + Learning Experiences** - Major programs linked  

### **THE CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**
Commit **cb1d615** contains **508 FILES** (303 HTML files!) that have barely been analyzed. This is where the bulk of missing functionality resides.

---

## 📊 **EFFICIENT ANALYSIS STRATEGY**

### **1. IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 30 minutes):**

```bash
# Check the MASSIVE commit
git show --name-only cb1d615 | grep -E "\\.html$" | grep -v "archived-bloat" | head -20

# Look for major missing directories  
find public -type d -name "*unit*" -o -name "*experience*" -o -name "*lesson*" | head -10

# Check for missing main pages
ls public/*.html | grep -E "(dashboard|portal|admin|student)" || echo "Check for missing dashboards"
```

### **2. USE GRAPHRAG FOR ANALYSIS:**
The GraphRAG is updated with 179 resources. Use it to identify gaps:
```bash
# Check what's in knowledge graph vs what's in filesystem
find public -name "*.html" | wc -l  # Should be much higher than 179
```

### **3. NAVIGATION AUDIT:**
```bash
# Find pages that aren't linked anywhere
grep -r "href=" public/index.html | grep -o 'href="[^"]*"' | sort | uniq
# Compare with actual files to find orphaned content
```

---

## 🔍 **COMMIT-BY-COMMIT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

### **HIGH-PRIORITY COMMITS TO ANALYZE:**

#### **cb1d615 - PRODUCTION READY (508 FILES!)** 🚨
```bash
git show --name-only cb1d615 | grep -E "\\.html$|\\.js$|\\.css$" | head -30
```
**Focus**: Firebase auth system, 303 HTML files, major functionality

#### **763b4b7 - FINAL COMPLETION (41 FILES)**
```bash
git show --name-only 763b4b7 | grep -v "archived-bloat"
```
**Focus**: Treaty of Waitangi enhancements, Unit 2 content

#### **ae5fa42 - UNIFIED SUPABASE + EXA.AI**
```bash
git show --name-only ae5fa42 | grep -E "\\.html$|\\.js$"
```
**Focus**: EXA.ai integration (✅ partially complete)

#### **0fde423 - AGENTIC LEARNING SYSTEM**
```bash
git show --name-only 0fde423 | grep -E "\\.html$|\\.js$"
```
**Focus**: Progress tracking, My Kete enhancements

## 🛠️ **SYSTEMATIC RESTORATION PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Inventory Missing Files**
```bash
# Create comprehensive file list from all major commits
for commit in cb1d615 763b4b7 ae5fa42 0fde423 f5fa24e; do
  echo "=== $commit ===" 
  git show --name-only $commit | grep -E "\\.html$|\\.js$|\\.css$" | head -10
done
```

### **Step 2: Check Existence**
```bash
# For each file found, verify if it exists
while IFS= read -r file; do
  [ -f "$file" ] && echo "✅ $file" || echo "❌ MISSING: $file"
done < file_list.txt
```

### **Step 3: Navigation Integration**
```bash
# For each existing file, check if it's linked in navigation
grep -r "filename.html" public/index.html || echo "ORPHANED: filename.html"
```

### **Step 4: Feature Integration**
```bash
# Check if advanced JS is loaded on pages
grep -r "progress-tracker.js\|deepseek-graphrag\|firebase-auth" public/*.html
```

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC MISSING PIECES TO INVESTIGATE**

### **Dashboard Systems:**
- Student dashboard (`public/student-dashboard.html` - check if exists)
- Teacher dashboard enhancements 
- Admin portal functionality

### **Unit System Integration:**
- Units 1-7 lesson navigation (`public/units/lessons/` directory)
- Learning pathway connections
- Assessment integration

### **Experience Modules:**
- `public/experiences/` directory structure
- Interactive learning modules
- Cultural experience integration

### **Advanced Features:**
- Firebase authentication full integration
- GraphRAG connections to UI
- EXA.ai content enhancement across platform

---

## 📋 **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **Navigation Completeness:**
- [ ] All HTML files in `public/` are accessible via navigation
- [ ] No orphaned content exists
- [ ] Mobile navigation includes all features

### **Integration Status:**
- [ ] All `.js` files are loaded on appropriate pages
- [ ] Authentication works across all features
- [ ] Progress tracking connected to all learning modules
- [ ] AI features (DeepSeek, EXA.ai) fully functional

### **Content Completeness:**
- [ ] All units/lessons from commits are accessible
- [ ] Handouts properly categorized and linked
- [ ] Cultural content properly integrated

---

## 🚀 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Immediate (1 hour):**
- Identify and restore 10+ missing major HTML pages
- Link all orphaned content to navigation
- Verify all .js integrations are working

### **Session Complete (2-3 hours):**
- All 508 files from cb1d615 analyzed and integrated
- No orphaned content exists
- Full platform functionality accessible to users
- GraphRAG updated with all discovered resources

---

## 🧠 **EFFICIENT GRAPHRAG UPDATE**

When updating the knowledge graph:
```bash
# Run our resource recovery script to scan new content
node scripts/resource-recovery.js

# The script will automatically:
# - Scan all HTML files
# - Extract metadata and cultural content
# - Generate relationships
# - Update te_kete_knowledge_graph.json
```

---

## 📝 **KEY FILES FOR CONTEXT**

1. **URGENT_RESTORATION_HANDOFF.md** - Critical missing pieces analysis
2. **COMPREHENSIVE_DESIGN_REVOLUTION_PLAN.md** - Future design vision
3. **te_kete_knowledge_graph.json** - Current resource state
4. **scripts/resource-recovery.js** - Automated resource discovery

---

## 🎯 **FINAL SUCCESS STATE**

Te Kete Ako should be a **comprehensive AI-powered educational ecosystem** with:
- **All content discoverable** via intuitive navigation
- **AI features fully functional** (DeepSeek, EXA.ai, GraphRAG)
- **Progress tracking** across all learning modules  
- **Cultural integration** throughout platform
- **Mobile-first experience** with cultural touchpoints
- **No hidden or orphaned functionality**

**REMEMBER**: This isn't just a content site - it's a sophisticated AI platform with hundreds of hours of advanced development work that needs to be made accessible to users!
