        <h2>Kia ora and Welcome to High School!</h2>
        <p>This starter pack will help you navigate your first year at high school with confidence. We've included practical tips, Māori perspectives on learning, and interactive activities to set you up for success.</p>

        <h3>Te Ao Māori Perspective on Transitions</h3>
        <p>In Māori tradition, transitions (huringa) are important times of growth. Just as the pūriri moth transforms, you are entering a new phase of learning. Remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You bring your whakapapa (genealogy) and unique strengths</li>
            <li>Learning is a collective journey - don't be afraid to ask for help</li>
            <li>Your kaiako (teachers) are here to guide you</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Essential Skills for Success</h2>
        
        <div class="activity-box">
            <h3>1. Organisation</h3>
            <p><strong>Whakataukī:</strong> "Ma pango, ma whero, ka oti te mahi" (With black and red, the work will be completed)</p>
            <p>Try these strategies:</p>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Use a planner or digital calendar for assignments</li>
                <li>Keep subject materials in separate folders</li>
                <li>Pack your bag the night before</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="activity-box">
            <h3>2. Time Management</h3>
            <p>The Māori lunar calendar (maramataka) teaches us about cycles and timing. Apply this wisdom:</p>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Break big tasks into smaller steps (divide your mahi)</li>
                <li>Prioritize tasks using the 4-quadrant method (urgent/important)</li>
                <li>Schedule regular breaks (pause to reflect)</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        
        <div class="activity-box">
            <h3>3. Study Skills</h3>
            <p>Traditional Māori learning was multi-sensory - use these approaches:</p>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Create visual mind maps (whakapapa of ideas)</li>
                <li>Teach concepts to someone else (tuakana-teina approach)</li>
                <li>Use mnemonic devices with Māori kupu (words)</li>
            </ul>
            <button class="interactive-btn" onclick="to remember key facts!')">Creative Study Idea</button>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Whanaungatanga (Building Relationships)</h2>
        <p>Success comes from strong connections. Try these relationship builders:</p>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Introduce yourself to at least one new person each week</li>
            <li>Join a school club or kapa haka group</li>
            <li>Practice active listening (whakarongo)</li>
            <li>Ask for help when needed - it shows strength</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <div class="maori-section">
        <h3>Cultural Safety Reminder</h3>
        <p>Our school is a place where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All cultural backgrounds are respected</li>
            <li>Māori knowledge is valued alongside other knowledge systems</li>
            <li>We practice manaakitanga (care for others)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you ever feel unsafe or disrespected, please talk to your dean or a trusted teacher.</p>
    </div>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
        <p>Complete this whakaaro (reflection) at the end of each term:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What am I most proud of this term?</li>
            <li>What was challenging, and how did I handle it?</li>
            <li>Who supported my learning journey?</li>
            <li>What will I focus on next term?</li>
        </ol>

## Learning Objectives
By using this resource, students will:
1. Develop practical organisational strategies for high school (NZC Key Competency: Managing Self)
2. Apply time management techniques informed by Māori perspectives (NZC Values: Excellence, Innovation)
3. Build positive relationships through whanaungatanga (NZC Key Competency: Relating to Others)
4. Reflect on their learning journey using Māori models of reflection (NZC Principle: Cultural Diversity)

## Cultural Context and Safety Notes
- The resource integrates Te Ao Māori concepts naturally throughout rather than as separate "add-ons"
- All Māori language is used in appropriate contexts with English translations
- Cultural safety is explicitly addressed with clear pathways for support
- The content presents Māori knowledge as equally valid to Western knowledge systems
- Protocols around sharing whakapapa or personal stories are respected by making them optional

## Teacher Implementation Guide
1. **Preparation**:
   - Print copies or share digital version via your LMS
   - Familiarize yourself with the Māori concepts (definitions provided in resource)

2. **Lesson 1: Introduction (40 mins)**
   - Begin with mihi/karakia if appropriate for your school
   - Have students complete a "pre-assessment" of their current skills
   - Work through the Organisation section together

3. **Lesson 2: Time Management (40 mins)**
   - Discuss the maramataka concept
   - Have students create their own weekly schedule
   - Practice breaking down a sample assignment

4. **Lesson 3: Study Skills (40 mins)**
   - Demonstrate multi-sensory study techniques
   - Have students create mind maps for a current topic
   - Practice the tuakana-teina method in pairs

5. **Ongoing Use**:
   - Refer back to sections as needed throughout the year
   - Use the reflection questions at term ends
   - Revisit whanaungatanga activities periodically

## Assessment Suggestions
1. **Formative**:
   - Observation of students applying strategies
   - Weekly check-ins on organisation systems
   - Peer feedback on study techniques

2. **Summative**:
   - End-of-term reflection submission
   - Portfolio showing applied strategies
   - Presentation on "What Works for Me"

**Rubric Criteria**:
- Consistent use of organisational systems
- Effective application of time management
- Quality of reflections on learning
- Demonstrated understanding of cultural concepts

## Extension Activities
1. Research and compare traditional Māori education (whare wānanga) with modern systems
2. Create a digital resource teaching study skills to Year 8 students
3. Interview family/community members about their high school transitions
4. Develop a personal "learning pepeha" that identifies strengths and support systems

## Adaptations for Diverse Learners
**For students needing additional support**:
- Provide pre-highlighted versions with key points
- Create visual timetables with icons
- Offer sentence starters for reflections
- Allow verbal rather than written responses

**For English Language Learners**:
- Include glossary of key terms
- Use more visual supports
- Pair with bilingual buddies
- Provide audio versions

**For advanced learners**:
- Challenge to mentor younger students
- Research deeper into Māori educational traditions
- Create their own whakataukī about learning
- Develop a transition guide for international students
