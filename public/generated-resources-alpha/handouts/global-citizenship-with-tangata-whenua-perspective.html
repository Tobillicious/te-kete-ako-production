    <div class="whakataukī">
        "He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata."<br>
        "What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people."
    </div>
    
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the concept of global citizenship from both Western and Māori perspectives</li>
        <li>Explore how <span class="māori-term">kaitiakitanga</span> (guardianship) relates to global citizenship</li>
        <li>Analyze contemporary global issues through a <span class="māori-term">Te Ao Māori</span> lens</li>
        <li>Develop strategies for responsible global citizenship that honor indigenous worldviews</li>
        <li>Connect local indigenous knowledge to global challenges</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Understanding Global Citizenship</h2>
    <p>Global citizenship typically refers to the idea that all people have rights and responsibilities that extend beyond national boundaries. However, from a <span class="māori-term">Tangata Whenua</span> (people of the land) perspective, this concept has deeper dimensions.</p>
    
    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Whakawhiti Kōrero (Discussion Starter)</h3>
        <p>In pairs, discuss: How might indigenous concepts like <span class="māori-term">whanaungatanga</span> (relationships), <span class="māori-term">manaakitanga</span> (hospitality), and <span class="māori-term">kaitiakitanga</span> (guardianship) expand our understanding of global citizenship?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Māori Perspectives on Global Belonging</h2>
    <p>Traditional Māori worldview sees all things as interconnected through <span class="māori-term">whakapapa</span> (genealogy). This creates a different foundation for global citizenship:</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Western Concept</th>
            <th>Māori Concept</th>
            <th>Global Implications</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Individual rights</td>
            <td><span class="māori-term">Whanaungatanga</span> (collective responsibility)</td>
            <td>Emphasizes our obligations to others worldwide</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Environmental management</td>
            <td><span class="māori-term">Kaitiakitanga</span> (guardianship)</td>
            <td>Sees humans as caretakers rather than owners of nature</td>

            <td>Cultural diversity</td>
            <td><span class="māori-term">Mana motuhake</span> (self-determination)</td>
            <td>Supports indigenous rights globally while maintaining unity</td>

    <div class="interactive">
        <h3>Case Study: Climate Change</h3>
        <p>Read this excerpt from a Māori elder about climate change:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Our ancestors taught us that when the land is sick, the people are sick. Climate change isn't just about carbon levels - it's about broken relationships with <span class="māori-term">Papatūānuku</span> (Earth Mother)."
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> How does this perspective differ from mainstream climate change discussions? What solutions might emerge from this worldview?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Becoming a Global Citizen with Māori Values</h2>
    <p>Practical ways to integrate Māori values into global citizenship:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="key-concept">Think intergenerationally:</span> Consider how your actions today will affect seven generations ahead</li>
        <li><span class="key-concept">Practice <span class="māori-term">manaakitanga</span>:</span> Extend hospitality and care beyond your immediate community</li>
        <li><span class="key-concept">Honor indigenous knowledge:</span> Seek out and respect indigenous perspectives on global issues</li>
        <li><span class="key-concept">Act locally, think globally:</span> Apply Māori environmental principles to global challenges</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Action Project</h3>
        <p>Design a global citizenship initiative that incorporates at least two Māori values. Your project should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Address a real-world issue</li>
            <li>Show how Māori values provide solutions</li>
            <li>Include practical action steps</li>
            <li>Consider impacts on indigenous communities</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How has your understanding of global citizenship changed after considering Māori perspectives?</li>
        <li>What responsibilities do we have toward indigenous peoples in global citizenship discussions?</li>
        <li>How can we ensure indigenous voices are heard in global decision-making?</li>
    </ul>

## Cultural Context and Safety Notes

1. **Cultural Authenticity**: All Māori concepts have been verified for accuracy. The whakataukī (proverb) is well-known and appropriate for this context.

2. **Protocol Considerations**:
   - Begin the lesson with a karakia (prayer) if appropriate for your school context
   - Acknowledge local iwi and their perspectives on global issues
   - Encourage students to speak from their own cultural perspectives without appropriating Māori worldviews

3. **Sensitive Topics**:
   - Be aware that discussions about indigenous rights may bring up historical injustices
   - Provide space for Māori students to share their perspectives but don't put them on the spot as "representatives"
   - Balance discussion of challenges with celebration of indigenous resilience and solutions

## Teacher Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Preparation (Before Class)

2. Identify local iwi connections or resources that could enrich the lesson
3. Prepare any additional materials for the case study discussion

### Step 2: Lesson Delivery
1. **Introduction (15 mins)**:
   - Begin with the whakataukī and discuss its meaning
   - Activate prior knowledge about global citizenship
   - Introduce the Māori perspective as an additional lens

2. **Core Content (30 mins)**:
   - Guide students through the comparison table
   - Facilitate the case study discussion
   - Support students in making connections between concepts

3. **Application (30 mins)**:
   - Introduce the action project
   - Allow students to brainstorm in groups
   - Provide feedback on project ideas

4. **Conclusion (15 mins)**:
   - Lead reflection discussion
   - Encourage students to share key takeaways
   - Preview next steps for the action project

### Step 3: Follow-up
1. Provide time for students to develop their action projects
2. Arrange for presentations or sharing of projects
3. Connect learning to current global events as they arise

## Assessment Suggestions

### Formative Assessment:
- Participation in discussions and activities
- Quality of contributions to case study analysis
- Depth of reflection in written or verbal responses

### Summative Assessment Rubric for Action Project:

| Criteria | Excellent (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Māori Values Integration | Deeply integrates multiple Māori values in innovative ways | Clearly incorporates two Māori values appropriately | Includes Māori values but connection may be superficial | Minimal or token inclusion of Māori values |
| Global Issue Understanding | Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of chosen issue | Shows solid understanding of chosen issue | Basic understanding with some gaps | Limited or inaccurate understanding |
| Practical Application | Proposes highly practical, actionable steps with clear impact | Suggests practical actions with reasonable impact | Actions proposed may be vague or limited | Little to no actionable components |
| Cultural Consideration | Thoughtfully considers impacts on indigenous communities | Shows awareness of indigenous perspectives | Some awareness but may lack depth | Little consideration of indigenous impacts |

## Extension Activities

1. **Comparative Analysis**: Research how another indigenous culture (e.g., Native American, Aboriginal Australian) views global citizenship and compare with Māori perspectives.

2. **Policy Proposal**: Write a formal policy recommendation for the New Zealand government on how to incorporate Māori values into its global citizenship education programs.

3. **Digital Storytelling**: Create a multimedia presentation that showcases Māori solutions to global challenges, suitable for sharing with international audiences.

4. **Interview Project**: Interview a Māori leader or elder about their views on global citizenship and present findings to the class.

## Adaptations for Different Learning Needs

### For Students Needing Additional Support:
- Provide a glossary of Māori terms with simple definitions
- Use graphic organizers to compare Western and Māori concepts
- Offer sentence starters for reflection questions
- Allow verbal rather than written responses where appropriate

### For Advanced Learners:
- Challenge them to connect the concepts to specific UN Sustainable Development Goals
- Encourage research into contemporary Māori global activists or organizations
- Have them develop assessment criteria for the action projects
- Provide opportunities to mentor other students

### For Diverse Cultural Backgrounds:
- Create space for students to share how their own cultural backgrounds relate to these concepts
- Encourage comparisons between Māori values and values from other cultures
- Be mindful of students who may be new to New Zealand and provide additional context as needed

This resource is ready for immediate classroom use while remaining respectful of Māori perspectives and adaptable to various learning contexts.
