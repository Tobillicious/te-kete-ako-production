        </ol>
        <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> In small groups, develop a financial plan for a community project that incorporates at least three Māori economic principles.</p>

## Cultural Context and Safety Notes

1. **Cultural Authenticity**: This resource has been developed in consultation with Māori educational specialists to ensure accurate representation of Māori economic concepts.

2. **Te Reo Māori Usage**: All Māori terms are used appropriately with English translations. Pronunciation guides should be provided when speaking these terms aloud.

3. **Cultural Safety**: 
   - Avoid making direct comparisons that position one economic system as superior to another
   - Acknowledge the diversity of Māori perspectives on economics
   - Create space for Māori students to share their experiences if they choose
   - Be mindful that some financial concepts may be sensitive for students from low-income backgrounds

4. **Protocols**: 
   - Begin with a karakia (prayer) if appropriate for your class
   - Acknowledge local iwi and their economic practices where possible
   - Follow school protocols for cultural activities
