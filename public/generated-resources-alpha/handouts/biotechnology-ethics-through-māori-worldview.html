    </div>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This resource explores ethical considerations in biotechnology through the lens of Te Ao Māori (the Māori worldview). We will examine how Māori concepts like <span class="key-term">kaitiakitanga</span> (guardianship), <span class="term">whakapapa</span> (genealogy), and <span class="term">tapu</span> (sacredness) provide unique perspectives on contemporary biotechnological issues.</p>
    
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand key Māori ethical frameworks relevant to biotechnology</li>
        <li>Analyze biotechnological issues through both Western and Māori perspectives</li>
        <li>Evaluate the cultural implications of genetic modification and other biotechnologies</li>
        <li>Develop culturally informed positions on biotechnological ethics</li>
        <li>Communicate ethical considerations using appropriate Māori concepts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Cultural Context</h2>
    <p>Māori perspectives on biotechnology are deeply connected to concepts of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-term">Whakapapa</span> - The interconnectedness of all living things through genealogy</li>
        <li><span class="key-term">Mauri</span> - The life force present in all living things</li>
        <li><span class="key-term">Tapu</span> - The sacredness of certain organisms and biological materials</li>
        <li><span class="key-term">Kaitiakitanga</span> - The responsibility to protect and care for the environment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Activity 1: Comparing Ethical Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Compare Western bioethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) with Māori ethical concepts listed above. Create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-study">
        <h3>Case Study: Genetic Modification of Native Species</h3>
        <p>Scientists propose using gene drives to eliminate introduced predators threatening native birds. Consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How might Māori view the modification of any species' whakapapa?</li>
            <li>What are the kaitiakitanga responsibilities in this situation?</li>
            <li>Does the potential benefit to native species justify the means?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="discussion-points">
        <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How does the concept of mauri affect views on creating artificial life forms?</li>
            <li>What cultural protocols might need to be considered when working with human DNA from Māori participants?</li>
            <li>How can Western science and mātauranga Māori work together in biotechnology?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <div class="assessment">
        <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Write a formal report analyzing a biotechnological issue through both Western and Māori ethical frameworks (1000 words)</p>
        <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Create a digital presentation comparing perspectives on a biotech issue, including interviews with Māori experts</p>
        <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Participate in a formal debate on a biotech issue, demonstrating understanding of Māori perspectives</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Extension Activities</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Advanced Research</h3>
        <p>Investigate the WAI 262 claim regarding Māori rights over indigenous flora and fauna. How does this relate to biotechnology patents?</p>
        
        <h3>Creative Response</h3>
        <p>Create an artwork or digital story that expresses Māori perspectives on biotechnology using traditional and contemporary media.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Teacher Notes</h2>
    <h3>Implementation Guide</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Consult with local iwi or Māori advisors about appropriate protocols</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Introduce Māori ethical concepts through whakataukī and examples</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Case study analysis in small groups</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> Comparative ethical framework activity</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 4-5:</strong> Research and assessment work</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Cultural Safety Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure proper pronunciation of Māori terms (provide audio if possible)</li>
        <li>Be aware that some students may have strong personal/cultural views</li>
        <li>Do not require students to share personal whakapapa if uncomfortable</li>
        <li>Present Māori perspectives as equally valid to Western perspectives</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Adaptations</h3>
    <p><strong>For ESOL students:</strong> Provide vocabulary lists with definitions, use more visual supports</p>
    <p><strong>For differentiated learning:</strong> Offer choice in assessment format, provide structured templates for ethical analysis</p>
    <p><strong>For extension:</strong> Connect with university researchers working in this field</p>
