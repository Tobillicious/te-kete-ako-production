## Learning Objectives (NZC Aligned)
1. **Understand** how Māori knowledge systems intersect with STEM disciplines (NZC Science: Understanding about science)
2. **Explore** diverse STEM career pathways that incorporate Māori perspectives (NZC Careers: Career management)
3. **Analyze** case studies of successful Māori STEM professionals (NZC Social Sciences: Identity, culture and organisation)
4. **Develop** a personal career pathway plan that integrates STEM interests with cultural values (NZC Health: Personal identity and self-worth)
5. **Evaluate** the role of STEM in addressing challenges facing Māori communities (NZC Technology: Nature of technology)

## Cultural Context & Safety Notes
- This lesson centers Māori worldviews in STEM education, validating indigenous knowledge systems
- Ensure pronunciation of te reo Māori is correct (provide audio support if needed)
- Be aware that some students may have limited exposure to STEM careers - maintain an inclusive approach
- Highlight diverse pathways (university, apprenticeships, iwi initiatives) to avoid privileging any single route
- Invite local Māori STEM professionals to share experiences where possible
- Create space for students to explore how their own cultural identity connects with STEM

## Teacher Implementation Guide

### Preparation (1-2 days before)
1. Familiarize yourself with the Māori STEM professionals mentioned
2. Prepare printed copies of career profiles for students who prefer hardcopy
3. Test all digital resources and links
4. Identify local Māori STEM role models who could potentially visit

### Lesson Flow (Suggested 2-3 sessions)

**Session 1: Introduction & Cultural Context**
1. Begin with karakia (optional) and whakataukī discussion (15 mins)
2. Present overview of Māori in STEM (20 mins)
3. Small group exploration of profile cards (25 mins)
4. Reflection: "What surprised you about these careers?" (10 mins)

**Session 2: Career Exploration**
1. Interactive career wheel activity (20 mins)
2. Case study research in pairs (30 mins)
3. Group sharing of findings (20 mins)

**Session 3: Pathway Planning**
1. Introduce STEM whakapapa activity (10 mins)
2. Individual work time with teacher support (40 mins)
3. Optional sharing of pathways (20 mins)
4. Closing reflection and next steps (10 mins)

   - Create a summary report of insights gained

## Adaptations for Diverse Learners

### For Students Needing Additional Support:
- Provide pre-selected, simplified case studies
- Offer template for career pathway planning
- Allow verbal rather than written responses where appropriate
- Pair with peer mentors during activities

### For Advanced Learners:
- Challenge to research tertiary pathways for specific careers
- Develop a comparative analysis of Western and Māori approaches to a STEM field
- Create a resource promoting STEM to younger Māori students

### For Distance Learners:
- Convert interactive activities to digital formats (e.g., online mindmaps)
- Set up virtual small group discussions
- Provide video recordings of profile information

### For Students with Limited Digital Access:
- Print all digital resources in advance
- Offer offline activity alternatives
- Provide paper-based templates for all tasks
