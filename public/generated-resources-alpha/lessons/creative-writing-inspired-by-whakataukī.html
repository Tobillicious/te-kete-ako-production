        <ul>
            <li><strong>"He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tāngata, he tāngata, he tāngata."</strong><br>
            <em>"What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people."</em></li>
            <li><strong>"Kia kaha, kia māia, kia manawanui."</strong><br>

            <li>Can you create a fictional story that embodies its message?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a href="#" class="btn">Share Your Writing</a>
