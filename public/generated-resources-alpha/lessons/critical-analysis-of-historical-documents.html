    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze primary sources from colonial and Māori viewpoints.</li>
            <li>Understand how historical narratives are shaped by perspective.</li>
            <li>Evaluate bias and reliability in historical documents.</li>
            <li>Develop critical thinking skills in historical interpretation.</li>
            <li>Engage with <span class="maori-term">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> and related documents.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="interactive">
        <h3>Starter Activity: Whakataukī (Māori Proverb)</h3>
        <p><em>"Kia whakatōmuri te haere whakamua" – "I walk backwards into the future with my eyes fixed on the past."</em></p>
        <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> What does this whakataukī suggest about the importance of history?</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Historical Documents</h3>
    <p>We will examine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>English version of the Treaty of Waitangi</strong> (1840)</li>
        <li><strong>Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Māori version)</strong> (1840)</li>
        <li><strong>Letters from early settlers</strong> (e.g., Edward Gibbon Wakefield)</li>
        <li><strong>Māori petitions to the Crown</strong> (e.g., 1860s land protests)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Comparative Analysis Task</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In pairs, select one colonial and one Māori document.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the <strong>OPVL method</strong> (Origin, Purpose, Value, Limitation) to analyze each.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Present findings in a Venn diagram comparing perspectives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interactive">
        <h3>Digital Exploration</h3>
        <p>Explore <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NZ History</a> and <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Te Ara</a> for additional sources.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Reflection & Discussion</h3>
    <p><strong>Guiding Questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do language differences in Te Tiriti vs. the Treaty affect interpretation?</li>
        <li>Why might colonial records dominate historical narratives?</li>
        <li>How can we ensure Māori voices are heard in history?</li>
    </ul>

## **Cultural Context & Safety Notes**  

- **Cultural Sensitivity:**  
  - Acknowledge that some historical documents may contain offensive language or perspectives.  
  - Ensure Māori perspectives are given equal weight, not just as a "response" to colonial narratives.  
  - Use correct te reo Māori terms (e.g., <span class="maori-term">Te Tiriti</span>, not just "The Treaty").  

- **Tikanga Considerations:**  
  - Begin with a <span class="maori-term">karakia</span> (prayer) or <span class="maori-term">whakataukī</span> to set a respectful tone.  
  - Encourage students to engage with Māori sources as living voices, not just historical artifacts.

## **Teacher Implementation Guide**  

### **Step-by-Step Lesson Plan**  

1. **Introduction (10 min)**  
   - Discuss the whakataukī and its relevance to historical study.  
   - Introduce key documents (provide printed copies or digital access).  

2. **Document Analysis (25 min)**  
   - Students work in pairs using the OPVL method.  
   - Scaffold with guiding questions (e.g., "Who wrote this? For what audience?").  

3. **Comparative Discussion (15 min)**  
   - Groups share findings via Venn diagrams (digital or poster).  
   - Highlight discrepancies between Māori and colonial accounts.  

4. **Reflection (10 min)**  
   - Whole-class discussion on bias and historical silence.

## **Assessment Suggestions**  

| **Criteria**               | **Achieved** | **Merit** | **Excellence** |
|----------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Identifies perspectives    | Lists differences | Explains why differences exist | Evaluates impact of differing narratives |
| Uses evidence              | Quotes documents | Compares sources critically | Synthesizes multiple sources |
| Cultural awareness         | Recognises Māori voice | Analyses power dynamics | Proposes ways to address historical bias |

**Alternative Assessment:**  
- **Creative Response:** Students rewrite a historical event from an alternative perspective.  

---

## **Extension Activities**  

1. **Debate:** "Should New Zealand history prioritize Māori narratives over colonial records?"  
2. **Research Project:** Compare a local <span class="maori-term">hapū</span> (sub-tribe) account with government records.  
3. **Digital Storytelling:** Create a short documentary contrasting perspectives on a key event.  

---

## **Adaptations for Diverse Learners**  

- **Visual Learners:** Use graphic organizers (timelines, comparison charts).  
- **ESOL Students:** Provide glossaries of key terms in te reo Māori and English.  
- **Kinesthetic Learners:** Role-play historical figures in a mock debate.
