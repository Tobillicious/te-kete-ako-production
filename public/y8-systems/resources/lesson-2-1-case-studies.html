            <p>In New Zealand, citizens over 18 vote every three years to elect members to Parliament. The political party with the most members, or a coalition of parties, forms the government and chooses the Prime Minister. There are many different political parties, and people are free to criticize the government and protest peacefully. The laws, created by Parliament, apply to everyone, including the Prime Minister. News media is independent and can report on anything it chooses.</p>

            <p>Emperor Nero ruled the Roman Empire with absolute authority. He was not elected and his power was for life. He could create laws, declare war, and order executions without trial. Senators and officials served at his pleasure and could be removed or killed if they displeased him. There was no freedom of speech; criticizing the Emperor was considered treason and was punishable by death. The Emperor controlled the military and used it to enforce his rule and crush any opposition.</p>
