                <p>
                    The great urban migration presented Māori with a profound challenge to their identity. Traditionally, being Māori was tied to a specific place (whenua), a specific tribe (iwi), and a specific mountain and river. In the city, away from these anchors, what did it mean to be Māori? This handout explores how Māori adapted and innovated, creating new institutions and a new, pan-tribal identity that could thrive in the urban environment.

                        <div class="concept-content">
                            <p>In rural areas, your primary identity was your iwi (e.g., Ngāpuhi, Tainui, Ngāti Porou). In the city, you were often simply "Māori." This forced people from different tribes to find common ground. They were united by a shared language, shared experiences of discrimination, and a shared desire to maintain their culture. This led to the rise of a pan-tribal identity, where being Māori became as important, and sometimes more important, than one's specific iwi affiliation.</p>

                        <div class="concept-content">
                            <p>The traditional institutions of the marae and the pā were not available in the city. So, Māori created new ones. They established "urban marae" like Ngā Whare Waatea in Māngere, which served people from all iwi. They formed voluntary organisations like the Māori Women's Welfare League, which provided vital support networks for whānau navigating the challenges of city life. These new institutions became the new centres of Māori community and culture.</p>

                            <p>Māori culture did not disappear in the city; it adapted. Kapa haka groups became a vital way to maintain language, stories, and performance traditions. New forms of music and art emerged that blended traditional elements with modern urban influences. The city became a melting pot where different tribal styles and traditions mixed, creating new, dynamic forms of cultural expression.</p>

                            <p>The concentration of Māori in cities created a new political consciousness. Living together, Māori began to see their problems not as isolated issues, but as a pattern of systemic inequality. The shared experience of poor housing, discrimination in employment, and racism from the police helped to fuel the urban-based protest movements of the 1970s, such as the Polynesian Panthers and Ngā Tamatoa. The city became the engine room of Māori political activism.</p>
