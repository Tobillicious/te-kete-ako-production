            <p>Traditional MƒÅori games (<span class="maori-term">tƒÅkaro</span>) were not just for entertainment - they developed important skills including strategic thinking, pattern recognition, and mathematical reasoning. In this resource, we'll explore how these traditional games can help us understand algebraic concepts.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Note</h3>
                <p>MƒÅori games (<span class="maori-term">tƒÅkaro</span>) were traditionally used to develop physical skills, mental agility, and social cohesion. They were often connected to stories, values, and the natural world. When engaging with these activities, we acknowledge the cultural heritage and wisdom embedded within them.</p>
