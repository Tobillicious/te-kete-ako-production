                <p>
                    History is not a single story. It is a collection of perspectives, and the "official" version often depends on who held the power and the pen. During the Aotearoa Wars, the same events were described in vastly different ways by colonial newspapers and by MƒÅori oral histories. This activity asks you to be a critical historian by comparing two primary source accounts of the same event and analysing them for bias, purpose, and propaganda.

The enemy, who fought with the savage courage of their race, were completely routed. The Queen's flag now flies over their principal fortress, and a severe lesson has been taught to the misguided natives who dared to challenge British authority. The bravery of our soldiers, under the command of General Cameron, was beyond all praise. This decisive action will, we trust, bring a speedy conclusion to this unhappy rebellion."

They came again, and we drove them back again. We were not defeated. In the night, a white flag was raised by some of our old chiefs, against the wishes of the warriors.
