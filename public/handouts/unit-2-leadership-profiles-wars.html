                    The Aotearoa Wars were not just a series of battles; they were a conflict of sovereignty, culture, and vision. The Māori leaders who emerged during this time were not simply warriors. They were prophets, strategists, diplomats, and visionaries who developed diverse and sophisticated strategies to protect their people and their land. This handout explores the profiles of five key leaders, each with a unique approach to resistance.

                            <p><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> Armed resistance and psychological warfare.</p>
                            <p>Unjustly exiled to the Chatham Islands without trial, Te Kooti escaped and waged a brilliant and devastating guerrilla war against colonial forces. His strategies involved lightning-fast raids, expert use of terrain, and building a powerful spiritual movement, Ringatū, which gave his followers immense resilience. His war was one of retribution (utu) for the breaking of the rule of law by the Crown.</p>
                            <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> A symbol of Māori resistance to injustice and the founder of a lasting faith. His story highlights how spiritual conviction can fuel a powerful resistance movement.</p>

                            <p><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> Non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.</p>
                            <p>At his community of Parihaka, Te Whiti led a campaign of passive resistance against land confiscation. His followers ploughed settlers' fields and built fences across roads, meeting armed soldiers with food and songs. Te Whiti's goal was to expose the government's injustice through moral strength, not violence. He famously said, "Though some... might wish to take arms and kill the aggressors, I say it must not be."</p>
                            <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> An icon of peaceful protest whose methods pre-dated Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Parihaka remains a powerful symbol of non-violent resistance worldwide.</p>

                            <p><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> Tactical brilliance and innovative fortification.</p>
                            <p>Considered one of the greatest military commanders in New Zealand history, Tītokowaru led a highly effective campaign in South Taranaki. He designed innovative pā (fortifications) with underground bunkers and rifle pits that could withstand heavy artillery. His forces were disciplined and used psychological warfare effectively. Later in life, he renounced violence and became a key supporter of Te Whiti's peace movement.</p>
                            <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> A master strategist who proved that Māori military technology and tactics were often superior to those of the British. His life shows that a leader can be both a formidable warrior and a powerful advocate for peace.</p>

                            <p><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> Diplomacy, political negotiation, and establishing Māori self-governance.</p>
                            <p>As the second Māori King, Tāwhiao led his people through the trauma of the Waikato War and the massive land confiscations that followed. He focused on maintaining the Kīngitanga (Māori King Movement) as a separate political authority and a symbol of Māori unity. He travelled to England to petition Queen Victoria directly and spent decades advocating for peace, self-sufficiency, and the restoration of Māori mana.</p>
                            <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Ensured the survival of the Kīngitanga, which remains a vital institution today. He represents the strategy of political resistance and the fight to maintain sovereignty through diplomacy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> Symbolic acts of defiance and direct challenge to Crown authority.</p>
                            <p>One of the first chiefs to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, Hōne Heke quickly became disillusioned with British rule. He saw the flagstaff at Kororāreka as a symbol of lost Māori authority and had it cut down four times. This was not vandalism; it was a deliberate political statement. His actions sparked the Northern War, a conflict designed to force the British to honour their promises and respect Māori mana.</p>
                            <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> A symbol of the fight against broken promises. Heke's actions show that resistance can begin with powerful symbolic acts that challenge the legitimacy of an oppressor.</p>
