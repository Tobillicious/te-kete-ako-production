On the positive side, urban migration provided economic opportunities and access to better healthcare and education, which improved physical and economic wellbeing for many families. However, it also caused significant challenges to spiritual and cultural wellbeing. Māori families moving to cities often experienced disconnection from their ancestral lands (whenua), separation from extended whānau, and difficulty maintaining traditional practices like kapa haka and te reo Māori. This shows that wellbeing is holistic - improving one aspect (like economic wellbeing) can sometimes negatively impact another (like cultural wellbeing). Understanding this complexity helps us appreciate why Dr. Ranginui Walker dedicated his research to urban Māori communities."</em></p>        </div>        <!-- Lesson Sequence -->        <section>            <h2>⏱️ Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)</h2>            <table class="lesson-timing-table">                <thead>                    <tr>                        <th width="15%">Time</th>                        <th width="25%">Activity</th>                        <th width="60%">Description & Teacher Guidance</th>                    </tr>                </thead>                <tbody>                    <tr>                        <td><strong>0-5 min</strong></td>                        <td><strong>DO NOW</strong><br>Whakawhanaungatanga</td>                        <td>Greet students. <strong>DO NOW:</strong> On the board: <em>"If you had to move from your hometown to a big city, what would you miss most?
