Growing up during the Great Depression, Walker experienced firsthand the challenges facing Māori communities in the mid-20th century. His early years were shaped by traditional Māori values and the struggles of rural poverty, experiences that would profoundly influence his life's work.</p>            <p>Despite the barriers facing Māori students at the time, Walker pursued education with determination. He attended Auckland Teachers College and began his career as a rural school teacher. This role gave him insight into the educational disadvantages faced by Māori children in a system designed primarily for Pākehā students. His teaching experience sparked a lifelong commitment to educational equity and Māori student success.</p>            <p>Walker's academic journey continued as he earned degrees from the University of Auckland - a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and eventually a PhD in Anthropology. In 1973, he became the first Māori to hold the position of Head of Māori Studies at the University of Auckland, breaking significant barriers in New Zealand academia. This appointment was revolutionary at a time when Māori voices were largely absent from university leadership.</p>            <p>Alongside his academic career, Walker was a powerful <span class="vocab-highlight">activist</span>. In 1970, he became a founding member of <span class="vocab-highlight">Ngā Tamatoa</span> (The Young Warriors), a Māori protest movement that fought for Māori language rights, land rights, and cultural recognition. Ngā Tamatoa organized protests, petitions, and public demonstrations throughout the 1970s, helping to spark what became known as the Māori renaissance.</p>            <p>Dr. Walker's most famous work, "Ka Whawhai Tonu Mātou" (Struggle Without End), published in 1990, presented Māori history from a Māori perspective. The book challenged the <span class="vocab-highlight">dominant Pākehā narrative</span> that portrayed colonization as beneficial and peaceful. Instead, Walker documented the reality: land confiscation, cultural suppression, economic marginalization, and systematic discrimination. The book became essential reading for understanding New Zealand history from a Māori viewpoint.</p>            <p>Throughout his career, Walker advocated for the establishment and expansion of the Waitangi Tribunal, an institution created to address historical Treaty of Waitangi grievances. He understood that achieving <span class="vocab-highlight">tino rangatiratanga</span> (self-determination) required not just protest, but institutional change and official recognition of historical injustices.</p>            <p>Dr. Ranginui Walker passed away in 2016, but his legacy continues to shape New Zealand. His work transformed how the nation understands its history, elevated Māori perspectives in academia, and inspired generations of Māori scholars and activists. Walker's life demonstrates the power of education combined with cultural pride and unwavering commitment to truth and justice.</p>        </div>        <!-- Comprehension Questions -->        <div class="activity-box">            <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2C5F41;">📝 Comprehension Questions</h2>            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer these questions in complete sentences using evidence from the text.</p>            <ol>                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Where and when was Ranginui Walker born?</strong> What were the historical conditions of his early life?</li>                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>What were Walker's THREE main roles</strong> throughout his career?
