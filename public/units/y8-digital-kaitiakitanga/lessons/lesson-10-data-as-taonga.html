                    <p><strong>Kaitiaki Tikanga:</strong> Kia ora. Today we discuss a new kind of treasure—a digital taonga. Your name, your date of birth, your photos, your thoughts—this is your data. It holds your whakapapa, your story. Like any taonga, it is precious and must be guarded with care. This is a core part of our responsibility to our whānau.</p>

Today, we will analyse the science of creating strong locks to protect our valuable data assets. Let's examine the system.</p>

                        <li><strong>The Twist (10 mins):</strong> Halfway through, the teacher asks one student in the chain for a friend's favourite colour. That student might know it and pass it on. Discuss: "How did Student X's information get shared? Did they give permission? How does one person's information getting out sometimes lead to their friend's information getting out?" This introduces the core idea that our data is connected.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What Makes a Strong Password? (10 mins):</strong> Kaitiaki Pūtaiao explains the science of passwords. It's not just about making it hard to guess; it's about making it hard for a computer to crack. Key factors:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Length:</strong> The single most important factor.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                                <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Not using the same password everywhere.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Password Analysis (20 mins):</strong> In pairs, students use the 'Password Strength Lab' handout. They will analyse a list of example passwords, grading them against the criteria and calculating a "strength score."</li>
                        <li><strong>Sharing Lab Results (5 mins):</strong> The class discusses: Which password was the strongest? Which was weakest? Were there any surprises?</li>

                    <div class="teacher-note">

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Introducing the Technique (10 mins):</strong> The teacher introduces a simple, effective technique for creating strong, memorable passwords: combining three random, unrelated words (e.g., "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple"). This creates length, is easy to remember, and can be made complex (e.g., "C0rrect-H0rse-B@ttery!").</li>
                        <li><strong>Password Creation Challenge (10 mins):</strong> Each student uses the technique to create a new, strong, secret password on their handout. They then grade their own creation using the strength score system.</li>

                    <div class="assessment-opportunity">
                        <strong>Formative Assessment:</strong> The completed 'Password Strength Lab' handout shows if they can analyse security effectively. The password they create for the final challenge demonstrates their ability to apply the technique correctly.
