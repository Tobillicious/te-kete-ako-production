We learn to become guardians of our own energy.</p>

                        <li><strong>Setup (5 mins):</strong> The teacher draws a large "energy meter" on the board, from "Drained" (empty) to "Energised" (full).</li>
                        <li><strong>Activity (10 mins):</strong> The teacher calls out different activities (digital and non-digital). After each one, students move to stand at the point on the energy meter that reflects how that activity makes them feel.

                        <li><strong>Introducing the Audit (5 mins):</strong> The teacher introduces the 'My Mauri Audit' handout. "This is a tool for you to become a scientist of your own energy. For the next 24 hours, you will be a kaitiaki of your mauri, noticing where it goes."</li>
                        <li><strong>Guided Practice (15 mins):</strong> As a class, students fill out the first section of the handout: "My Digital Habits." They list the top 3-5 apps or digital activities they spend the most time on. Then, for just ONE of those activities, the teacher guides them through the analysis questions on the handout.</li>
                        <li><strong>The 24-Hour Challenge (15 mins):</strong> The teacher explains the main task: For the next 24 hours, students are to use the handout to mindfully track their top 3 digital activities. They will note how they felt *before*, and how they felt *after*. They will then analyse their findings and create a "Mauri Protection Plan."</li>

                        <strong>Teacher Note:</strong> This is the main formative assessment for this lesson. The depth of their reflection is more important than the amount of time they track. Frame it as a personal, private investigation. The "Mauri Protection Plan" is the key part that shows they can apply their findings.

                        <li><strong>Building the Kete (5 mins):</strong> The teacher asks students to share one effective strategy they heard. These are collected on the board in a "Kete of Mauri Strategies" for the whole class to use. Examples might include: "Set a timer," "Turn off autoplay," "Follow accounts that make me feel good," "Unfollow accounts that make me feel drained."</li>
