                        <li><strong>Activity (10 mins):</strong> The teacher reads out simple online comments (e.g., "You're wrong," "I disagree, and here's why," "lol u suck," "Great idea!"). After each comment, students physically place themselves on the spectrum where they think the comment belongs. A brief discussion follows each one.</li>

                        <li><strong>Group Analysis (20 mins):</strong> Each card contains a short, anonymous online scenario (a comment on a video, a post, etc.). For each card, the group discusses and answers the analysis questions:
                            <ol>
                                <li>What is the mana of this k≈çrero (the feeling/power of the words)?</li>
