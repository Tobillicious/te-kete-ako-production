You have found your whenua with Kaitiaki Tikanga and learned the four walls from Kaitiaki Hauora. Fantastic! But what will your whare *look* like? What story will it tell? Today, you are the architects. You will design a blueprint for a digital whare that is uniquely yours—a place that is strong, beautiful, and safe. Let's make something amazing.</p>

                        <li><strong>Recap (5 mins):</strong> The teacher holds up two blank sheets of paper. On one is written "Whenua," on the other, "Te Whare Tapa Whā." Ask students: "What did we learn about these two ideas?"</li>
                        <li><strong>The Link (5 mins):</strong> The teacher places the "Whare" paper on top of the "Whenua" paper. "A whare needs its whenua. A plan needs a place. Today, we combine these ideas. We are not just building a house; we are designing a home. You are the architects, and this is your design brief."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Introducing the Blueprint (10 mins):</strong> The teacher introduces the 'My Digital Whare Blueprint' handout. They highlight the key areas: the central space for the drawing, and the annotation boxes for each of the four taha (walls). The teacher introduces Kaitiaki Toi's message and the idea of using visual metaphors. "What style is your whare? A modern glass house, open and connected? A strong, fortified pā, safe and secure? A cozy cabin, private and warm?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Creative Design Time (30 mins):</strong> Students work individually on their blueprints. They should be encouraged to be creative and detailed.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Task 1: Draw the Whare & Whenua.</strong> Students draw their whare on its whenua. What does the land look like? Are there gardens (positive spaces) or swamps (toxic areas)?</li>
                                <li><strong>Task 2: Annotate the Walls.</strong> In the boxes, students describe each wall. What makes it strong? What are its weak spots? What "materials" is it built from (e.g., "My Taha Whānau wall is built from daily chats with my friends and weekly video calls with my grandparents").</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to design a 'gate' or 'doorway' for their whare. What are the rules for entering their personal space? Who gets a key?</li>

                        <li><strong>Gallery Walk (10 mins):</strong> Students walk silently around the room, looking at the blueprints. The focus is on appreciating the different ideas, not on judging the artwork.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection (5 mins):</strong> Students return to their seats and write on a sticky note one "building material" or "design idea" they saw on another blueprint that they could use to strengthen their own whare. They can stick this onto their own blueprint.</li>
