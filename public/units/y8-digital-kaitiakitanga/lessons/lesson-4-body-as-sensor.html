And the most amazing system you will ever encounter is your own body. It's a highly advanced sensor array, constantly giving you data. Today, we will learn to read that data. We will investigate how our digital world physically interacts with our biological systems. Let's begin the experiment.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Setup (5 mins):</strong> Students are asked to hold their phone or a school device as if they were using it (texting, watching a video). They must hold this pose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observation (5 mins):</strong> While holding the pose, the teacher (guided by Kaitiaki Pūtaiao's voice) asks them to notice things: "Scan your body. What do you feel in your neck? Your shoulders? Your thumbs? Your eyes? Don't change anything, just notice. You are gathering data."</li>
                        <li><strong>Debrief (5 mins):</strong> Students relax and share their observations. What did they notice? Most will mention strain in their neck, shoulders, or hands. This provides a direct, physical entry point to the lesson.</li>

                        <li><strong>Mapping Activity (20 mins):</strong> Students use the handout to map the physical feelings they associate with different digital activities. They will connect specific activities (e.g., "scrolling TikTok," "playing Roblox," "doing homework on the laptop") to different parts of the body and describe the sensation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analysis (5 mins):</strong> Students answer the analysis questions on the handout, looking for patterns in their data.</li>

                            <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge students to add a "solution" to one of their negative sensation points. If their neck feels sore, what is a practical, ergonomic solution?</li>

                        <li><strong>Sharing Solutions (10 mins):</strong> Each group shares their best solution. The teacher or a student scribe can compile these into a "Taha Tinana Toolkit" poster for the classroom.</li>
