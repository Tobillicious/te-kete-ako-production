            <p>Your mission is to work in a whƒÅnau group to design and prototype a <strong>digital taonga</strong> that helps a specific audience strengthen <strong>one of the four walls</strong> of their digital whare.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Digital Taonga could be:</strong> A short animated video, an interactive quiz, a series of educational posters or infographics, a simple game, a podcast episode.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Audience could be:</strong> Younger students at your school, parents and caregivers, your own peers.</li>
                <li><strong>The Four Walls are:</strong> Taha Tinana, Taha Hinengaro, Taha WhƒÅnau, Taha Wairua.</li>
