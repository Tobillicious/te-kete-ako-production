## 2. Learning Objectives
-   Analyze the societal impact of large language models.
-   Apply prompt engineering techniques to achieve specific outcomes.
-   Evaluate the ethical risks associated with AI, including bias and security.
-   Connect AI concepts to a Te Ao Māori worldview, considering data sovereignty and digital mana.

## 3. Required Resources
### Handouts
-   `introduction-to-llms.html`: A primer on how large language models work.
-   `prompt-engineering-101.html`: An introductory guide to prompt engineering techniques.
