                <h4>Think of a Number</h4>
                <p>Play a "think of a number" game. "I'm thinking of a number. I add 5, and the answer is 13. What's my number?" Students work backwards. Explain that this is what we do when we solve equations: we perform the "inverse operation".</p>

                <h4>The Equation Balancer</h4>
                <p>Introduce the idea of an equation as a balanced scale. What you do to one side, you must do to the other. Use physical balance scales with weights if available, or draw them.</p>
                <p>Use the "Equation Balancer" handout. Students work through a series of one-step equations, showing their working by applying the inverse operation to both sides.</p>

                <h4>Create Your Own Problem</h4>
                <p>Students write their own simple word problem that can be solved with a one-step equation. They translate it into algebra and solve it. For example: "There were some birds on a wire. 5 flew away, and now there are 8 left. How many were there to start with?" (b - 5 = 8).</p>
                <p>Students can share their problems with a partner to solve.</p>
