            <p class="handout-subtitle">A fun and competitive game to practice solving one-step equations.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Divide the class into teams of 4-5 students. Have each team line up.</li>
                <li>Place a set of equation cards face down at the front of the room.</li>
                <li>On "Go!", the first person in each line runs to the front, takes a card, and solves the equation on a mini-whiteboard or piece of paper.</li>
                <li>They run back and show their answer to the teacher. If it's correct, the next person in their team can go. If it's incorrect, they must go back and fix it.</li>
                <li>The first team to have every member solve an equation correctly wins.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>y - 5 = 15</li>
