On the positive side, urban migration provided economic opportunities and access to better healthcare and education, which improved physical and economic wellbeing for many families. However, it also caused significant challenges to spiritual and cultural wellbeing. Māori families moving to cities often experienced disconnection from their ancestral lands (whenua), separation from extended whānau, and difficulty maintaining traditional practices like kapa haka and te reo Māori. This shows that wellbeing is holistic - improving one aspect (like economic wellbeing) can sometimes negatively impact another (like cultural wellbeing). Understanding this complexity helps us appreciate why Dr. Ranginui Walker dedicated his research to urban Māori communities."</em></p></div><!-- Lesson Sequence --><section><h2>⏱️ Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)</h2><table class="lesson-timing-table"><thead><tr><th width="15%">Time</th><th width="25%">Activity</th><th width="60%">Description &amp; Teacher Guidance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>0-5 min</strong></td><td><strong>DO NOW</strong><br/>Whakawhanaungatanga</td><td>Greet students. <strong>DO NOW:</strong> On the board: <em>"If you had to move from your hometown to a big city, what would you miss most? What would excite you?"</em> Students write 2-3 sentences.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-15 min</strong></td><td><strong>Explicit Teaching</strong><br/>Direct Instruction</td><td>Introduce the Learning Intention (WALT) and Success Criteria. Use the "Do Now" responses to introduce the concept of migration. Explain that in the 1940s-1970s, thousands of Māori families made this exact decision. Introduce the terms "push factors" (reasons to leave) and "pull factors" (reasons to move). Show the NZ map, highlighting rural areas and cities.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>15-40 min</strong></td><td><strong>Guided Practice</strong><br/>Student Activity</td><td>Distribute the "The Great Migration: Push and Pull Factors" handout. Students read the historical context. In pairs, they complete a T-chart identifying push factors (limited economic opportunities in rural areas, mechanization of farming, limited education/healthcare) and pull factors (factory jobs in cities, better housing, access to education, higher wages). Show WAGOLL example before they begin.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>40-60 min</strong></td><td><strong>Independent Practice</strong><br/>Application</td><td><strong>Connecting to Whaiora:</strong> Students write a paragraph answering: <em>"How did the Great Migration affect the wellbeing (Whaiora) of Māori families? Consider both positive and negative impacts."</em> Show WAGOLL paragraph. Encourage students to think about physical, mental, spiritual, and family wellbeing.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>60-75 min</strong></td><td><strong>Plenary</strong><br/>Wrap-up</td><td>Review the Learning Intention and Success Criteria. Discuss: <em>"Was the Great Migration ultimately positive or negative for Māori?"</em> (There's no single answer - emphasize complexity). <strong>Exit ticket:</strong> <em>"How does understanding the Great Migration help us understand Dr. Ranginui Walker's work on urban Māori identity?"</em></td></tr></tbody></table></section><!-- Differentiation --><section><h2>🎯 Differentiated Instruction &amp; Extension</h2><div class="differentiation-box"><div class="support-box"><h3>💚 For Students Who Need Extra Support:</h3><ul><li>Provide a partially completed push/pull factors chart</li><li>Offer a sentence frame: <em>"The Great Migration affected Māori wellbeing in both positive and negative ways.
