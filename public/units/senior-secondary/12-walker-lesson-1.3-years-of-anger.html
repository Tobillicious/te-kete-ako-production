When Māori activists saw injustice - land loss, language decline, systemic discrimination - they chose to rise up rather than accept the status quo. Groups like Ngā Tamatoa used marches, petitions, and occupations to demand change. While not all protests achieved immediate results, they were effective in raising public awareness and eventually leading to the Waitangi Tribunal and the Māori Language Act. Protest can be effective when it's organized, persistent, and focused on clear goals. However, it requires courage and often involves personal sacrifice, as many activists faced arrest and social criticism. The effectiveness of protest depends on whether those in power are willing to listen and change."</em></p></div><!-- Lesson Sequence --><section><h2>⏱️ Lesson Sequence (75 minutes)</h2><table class="lesson-timing-table"><thead><tr><th width="15%">Time</th><th width="25%">Activity</th><th width="60%">Description &amp; Teacher Guidance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>0-5 min</strong></td><td><strong>DO NOW</strong><br/>Whakawhanaungatanga</td><td>Greet students. <strong>DO NOW:</strong> <em>"When you see something unfair, do you: (a) stay silent, (b) speak up, or (c) take action? Explain your choice."</em> Students write 2-3 sentences.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-15 min</strong></td><td><strong>Explicit Teaching</strong><br/>Direct Instruction</td><td>Introduce WALT and Success Criteria. Use "Do Now" to introduce the concept of activism. Explain that by the 1970s, urban Māori (from Lesson 1.2) faced ongoing discrimination, poverty, and loss of cultural identity. Show images from protests. Introduce <strong>Ngā Tamatoa:</strong> founded at Auckland University in 1970, led by young Māori demanding change. Explain Dr. Walker was both participant and historian of this movement - his column <em>"Years of Anger"</em> documented this era.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>15-40 min</strong></td><td><strong>Guided Practice</strong><br/>Student Activity</td><td>Distribute "Ngā Tamatoa: The Young Warriors" handout. Students read about the group's formation, goals, and actions. In small groups (3-4), students complete a graphic organizer with three sections: 1) <strong>Grievances</strong> (What were they angry about?), 2) <strong>Strategies</strong> (How did they protest?), 3) <strong>Goals</strong> (What did they want to achieve?). Groups share findings with class. Teacher facilitates discussion on effectiveness of different strategies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>40-60 min</strong></td><td><strong>Independent Practice</strong><br/>Application</td><td><strong>Connecting to Whaiara:</strong> Students write a paragraph answering: <em>"How did the protest movements of the 1970s demonstrate the value of Whaiara (Rising Up)? Do you think protest is an effective way to create change?"</em> Show WAGOLL paragraph before they begin. Encourage students to use specific examples from the lesson and to consider both successes and limitations of the protests.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>60-75 min</strong></td><td><strong>Plenary</strong><br/>Wrap-up</td><td>Review WALT and Success Criteria. Class discussion: <em>"Dr. Walker wrote that the 1970s were 'Years of Anger.' Was this anger justified? Was it productive?"</em> <strong>Exit ticket:</strong> <em>"What is one question you have about the Māori protest movements that you want to explore further?"</em></td></tr></tbody></table></section><!-- Differentiation --><section><h2>🎯 Differentiated Instruction &amp; Extension</h2><div class="differentiation-box"><div class="support-box"><h3>💚 For Students Who Need Extra Support:</h3><ul><li>Provide a partially completed graphic organizer with some grievances, strategies, and goals already filled in</li><li>Offer sentence starters: <em>"The protest movements demonstrated Whaiara by ___.

Some students may have whānau who were activists; others may have whānau with different perspectives. Create a respectful space for diverse viewpoints</li><li><strong>Framing:</strong> Present activism as a response to genuine injustice, not as "troublemaking." Emphasize the courage and commitment of protesters</li><li><strong>Student Voice:</strong> If students have family stories about this era, invite them to share (but don't pressure anyone)</li><li><strong>Balance:</strong> Acknowledge that protest was controversial and not universally supported, even within Māori communities. Teach students to analyze multiple perspectives</li><li><strong>Connection to Present:</strong> Help students see the legacy of 1970s activism in contemporary Māori movements (e.g., te reo Māori revitalization, Treaty settlements)</li></ul><h3>Connection to Unit Theme:</h3><p>This lesson is pivotal: it shows how Dr. Walker moved from observing history to participating in it. His "Years of Anger" column gave voice to the protest generation and challenged the dominant narrative that Māori should be grateful and passive.</p><h3>Post-Lesson Reflection:</h3><ul><li><em>Did students understand why Māori were angry in the 1970s?</em></li><li><em>Were they able to analyze protest strategies critically (not just accept or reject them wholesale)?</em></li><li><em>How did students respond to the concept of "justified anger"?</em></li><li><em>Did the exit tickets reveal genuine curiosity about the protest movements?</em></li><li><em>Were any students uncomfortable with the content? How can I support them?</em></li></ul><h3>Teacher Preparation Note:</h3><p>Consider inviting a guest speaker who participated in 1970s activism (or showing a video interview) to make this history personal and real for students. Ensure cultural protocols are followed for any guest visitors.</p><h3>Historical Context:</h3><p>The 1970s protests led directly to the establishment of the Waitangi Tribunal (Lesson 1.4) and broader recognition of Māori rights. Help students see this lesson as part of a larger story of struggle and change.</p></div><!-- Unit Navigation --><div class="no-print" style="margin-top: 3rem; padding-top: 2rem; border-top: 2px solid #e5e7eb;"><h3>📚 Unit Navigation: Walker - The Challenge to the Narrative</h3><div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; margin-top: 1rem;"><a href="/lessons/walker-lesson-1.2-the-great-migration.html" style="padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem; background: #6c757d; color: white; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none;">← Previous: The Great Migration</a><a href="/units/walker/index.html" style="padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem; background: var(--color-pounamu); color: white; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none;">Unit Overview</a><a href="/lessons/walker-lesson-1.4-a-forum-for-justice.html" style="padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem; background: var(--color-secondary); color: white; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none;">Next Lesson: A Forum for Justice →</a></div></div></div><footer class="site-footer no-print" style="margin-top: 4rem; padding: 2rem; background: #f8f9fa; text-align: center;"><p><strong>Te Kete Ako</strong> | Educational Resources Honoring Te Ao Māori</p><p style="font-style: italic; color: #6c757d;">"Whaowhia te kete mātauranga" - Fill the basket of knowledge</p></footer><div id="footer-component"></div><script>    fetch('/components/footer.html')        .then(response => response.text())        .then(html => document.getElementById('footer-component').innerHTML = html);</script><!-- 🎨 ULTIMATE BEAUTY SYSTEM: Complete UX --><!-- Footer --><div id="footer-container"></div><script>  fetch('/components/footer.html').then(r=>r.text()).then(html=>{    document.getElementById('footer-container').innerHTML=html;  });</script><!-- Mobile Navigation --><div id="mobile-nav-bottom"></div><script>  fetch('/components/mobile-bottom-nav.html').then(r=>r.text()).then(html=>{    document.getElementById('mobile-nav-bottom').innerHTML=html;  });</script><!-- Floating Action Button (Help) --><div id="fab-quick-actions"></div><script>  fetch('/components/quick-actions-fab.html').then(r=>r.text()).then(html=>{    document.getElementById('fab-quick-actions').innerHTML=html;  });</script><!-- 🎨 ULTIMATE BEAUTY: Framer Cultural Gestures --><script src="/js/framer-cultural-gestures-ultimate.js" defer></script><!-- 📊 ULTIMATE BEAUTY: PostHog Analytics (Privacy-First) --><script src="/js/posthog-analytics.js" defer></script></body></html>
