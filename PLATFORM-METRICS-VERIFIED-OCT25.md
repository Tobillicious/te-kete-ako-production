## 📈 COMPARISON: DOCUMENTATION CLAIMS vs DATABASE REALITY

| Metric | Docs Claimed | Database Reality | Difference |
|--------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Resources | 2,867-24,971 (varied!) | 10,471 active user-facing | Clarified |
| GraphRAG Resources | 20,948 | 20,948 ✅ | **MATCH!** |
| Relationships | 318,674-1.18M (varied!) | 1,188,600 | **VERIFIED!** |
| Q90+ Quality | 57.9%-99.5% (varied!) | 76.6% | Accurate now |
| Avg Quality | 85.09-92.89 (varied!) | 88.30 | Verified |
| Cultural Integration | 67.47% | 75.75% | **EVEN BETTER!** |

**Synthesis Finding CONFIRMED:** Metrics were inconsistent because different tables/queries used.
