### **STEP 2: PUSH TO GITHUB (1 min)**

```bash
git push origin main
```

**What happens:**
- Changes push to GitHub repo
- Netlify detects new commit
- Netlify auto-builds and deploys
- Site goes LIVE in ~2-3 minutes!

**Watch deployment:**
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com
- Check deployment status
- Get live URL (probably `https://tekete.netlify.app`)

---

### **STEP 3: TEST LIVE SITE (5 min)**

Once deployed, test these critical features:

**Test 1: Homepage**
```
URL: https://tekete.netlify.app
Check: Beta badge appears (top-right)
Check: Onboarding tour shows after 2 seconds
Check: "500+ lessons" stat visible
```

**Test 2: GraphRAG Lessons (CRITICAL!)**
```
URL: https://tekete.netlify.app/lessons.html
Open Console (F12)
Look for: "🔥 Loading ALL lessons from GraphRAG..."
Look for: "✅ SUCCESS: Loaded XXX lessons"
Check: Lesson cards appear (should be 500+!)
```

**Test 3: Discovery Dropdown**
```
Click: "🔍 Discovery" in navigation
Check: Dropdown shows 4 orphaned gems
Check: Links to AI Ethics, Argumentative Writing, etc.
```

**Test 4: Help Dropdown**
```
Click: "❓ Help" in navigation
Check: Shows FAQ, Getting Started, Teacher Guide, Beta Feedback
```

**Test 5: Search**
```
Search: "year 8 math"
Check: Returns relevant results
```

---

## 🔥 **IF YOU WANT TO TEST BEFORE DEPLOYING:**

### **Local Testing (Safest!):**

**Start local server:**
```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean/public
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Open browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000
```

**Test everything:**
- Homepage (beta badge, onboarding)
- Lessons.html (GraphRAG loading)
- Navigation (Discovery, Help dropdowns)
- Search functionality

**If everything works locally:** Deploy with confidence! ✅

---

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS:**

### **When lessons.html loads:**
**Browser console should show:**
```
🔥 Loading ALL lessons from GraphRAG database...
✅ SUCCESS: Loaded 500+ lessons from GraphRAG!
```

**Page should show:**
- 500+ lesson cards (not just 100!)
- Each card with: Subject badge, Year level, Cultural badge, Quality score
- Filter dropdowns working (Year, Subject, Duration, Cultural)
- Pattern-koru-subtle background (you added!)

### **If GraphRAG fails:**
**Console might show:**
```
❌ GraphRAG load error: [error message]
```

**Don't panic!** Possible causes:
1. Supabase anon key expired (unlikely)
2. Table name mismatch (check spelling)
3. CORS issue (Netlify should handle)
4. Network timeout (try again)

**We can fix quickly if needed!**

---

## 📱 **TESTING ON REAL MOBILE:**

### **After deploying to Netlify:**

**On your iPhone/Android:**
1. Open Safari/Chrome
2. Go to: https://tekete.netlify.app
3. Test:
   - Touch navigation dropdown
   - Search for "math"
   - Open a lesson
   - Try printing (from FAB)
   - Check mobile bottom nav shows

**This is the REAL test!** Desktop testing only tells part of the story.
