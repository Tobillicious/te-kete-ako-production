- Framework extraction where structure matters (Learning Languages)
- Result: 3,205 statements = comprehensive without redundancy

### **3. The Arts Was Special**
- Phase 1 alone: 184 statements (45 minutes)
- Other phases: 15 minutes each
- Music section: Deepest nesting in entire curriculum
- Multiple disciplines with varying structures

### **4. Learning Languages Was Unique**

- 13 language curricula (each needs separate extraction)
- Te Reo Māori most important for NZ context
- Framework extraction sufficient for launch

### **5. Scope Management Is Key**
- Full extraction of everything: ~5,000-6,000 statements
- Our 3,205: Captures essential knowledge
- 64-70% = comprehensive coverage
