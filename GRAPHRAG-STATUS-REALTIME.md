# 🎯 GRAPHRAG STATUS - REAL-TIME

## ✅ WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

### Supabase Database (MAIN):
- **`resources` table: 8,037 resources** ✓
  - Handouts: 3,456
  - Lessons: 3,198  
  - Unit Plans: 847
  - Interactive: 264
  - Games: 134
  - Assessments: 87
  - Activities: 51

- **`graphrag_resources` table: 100** ✓ (JUST ADDED!)
  - Synced from resources table
  - Enhanced metadata
  - Ready for relationship mapping

- **`graphrag_relationships` table: 300+** ✓ (BUILDING NOW!)
  - has_handout: 100 relationships
  - related_content: 200 relationships
  - Auto-generated from resource data

### File System:
- **8,432 HTML files total**
- **1,000 analyzed with metadata**
- **13,695 relationships extracted**

### The Gap:
- Resources in Supabase: 8,037
- Resources in GraphRAG: 100 (scaling up)
- HTML on disk: 8,432
- **Action: Systematically sync all**

## 🚀 CURRENT PROGRESS

### Phase 1: Discovery ✓
- Found all 8,432 HTML files
- Discovered 8,037 already in database
- Identified 395 file gap

### Phase 2: Metadata Extraction ✓  
- Processed 1,000 files
- 977 high quality (97.7%)
- 978 culturally integrated (97.8%)
- 13,695 relationships mapped

### Phase 3: Upload IN PROGRESS
- ✓ Added 100 to graphrag_resources
- ✓ Building 300+ relationships
- ⏳ Scaling to full dataset

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Continue relationship building**
   - Target: 10,000 relationships
   - Types: has_handout, contains_lesson, prerequisite, related_content

2. **Sync all 8,037 resources to GraphRAG**
   - Batch size: 500 per insert
   - Include full metadata
   - Build cross-references

3. **Build intelligent learning paths**
   - Use relationships for sequencing
   - Create unit → lesson → handout chains
   - Map prerequisites

4. **Surface on platform**
   - Generate navigation from GraphRAG
   - AI-powered recommendations
   - Personalized learning paths

## 💡 THE REVELATION

**We don't have "multiple GraphRAGs" - we have:**
1. Main database (`resources`) - 8,037 items
2. Enhanced GraphRAG layer (`graphrag_*`) - building now
3. Local analysis files - for batch processing

**The real work: Connect them all intelligently!**
