SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type = 'learning_sequence' 
AND source_path LIKE '%mathematics%' LIMIT 3;

-- Query 3: Cultural connections
SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type = 'shared_cultural_element' LIMIT 3;

-- Query 4: STEM bridges (new!)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type = 'cross_curricular_bridge';

## 🔧 **FIX-READY STRATEGIES (For When Issues Found):**

**If Header Bug Returns:**
→ Apply CSS-in-component pattern directly to navigation-standard.html

**If Search Broken:**
→ Verify Supabase ANON key validity in supabase-singleton.js

**If Mobile Broken:**
→ Check viewport meta tag + Tailwind breakpoints in CSS

**If Console Errors:**
→ Identify smart quotes (curly quotes " " instead of straight " ")

**If Slow Performance:**
→ Check for N+1 queries, large payload transfers, or image optimization
