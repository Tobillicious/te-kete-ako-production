## üíé WHAT MAKES THIS WORLD-CLASS (Not Just Good)

### Comparison: Good vs. World-Class

| Good Lesson | World-Class (Walker Lesson) |
|------------|---------------------------|
| States topic | Asks compelling question |
| Lists objectives | Shows what success looks like (WAGOLL) |
| Mentions culture | Centers indigenous perspectives |
| Has worksheet | Has 3-tiered differentiation |
| Covers content | Builds critical consciousness |
| Teacher-focused | Student + teacher partnership |

### The Secret Sauce:
1. **Intellectual Depth** - Not dumbed down, challenges thinking
2. **Cultural Authenticity** - Created WITH cultural knowledge, not about it
3. **Practical Usability** - Teacher can literally follow this minute-by-minute
4. **Engagement Strategy** - Every activity has clear purpose
5. **Assessment for Learning** - Multiple check-ins, not just end test
