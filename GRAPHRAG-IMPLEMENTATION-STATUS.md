## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database**
```sql
-- Function created:
CREATE FUNCTION get_cross_subject_connections(limit_count INT)
RETURNS TABLE (
  source_title TEXT,
  source_subject TEXT,
  target_title TEXT,
  target_subject TEXT,
  relationship_type TEXT,
  confidence FLOAT,
  metadata JSONB
)

-- Tables used:
- graphrag_resources (19,737 rows)
- graphrag_relationships (231,469 rows)
```

### **Frontend**
```javascript
// Supabase client integration
const supabase = window.supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);

// Live queries on every page
const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('graphrag_resources')
    .select('*')
    .eq('subject', 'Science')
    .order('quality_score', { ascending: false });
```
