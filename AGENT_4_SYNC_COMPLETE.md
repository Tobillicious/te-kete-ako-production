## 📖 WHAT I NOW UNDERSTAND (VERIFIED):

### **Today's Actual Work:**
1. **1,555 pages** improved by multi-agent team (led by Agent-9)
2. **Sitewide consistency** achieved (65% → 95%)
3. **GraphRAG:** 1,421 resources indexed
4. **Components created:** Badge system, search bar, mobile polish

### **Canonical Files:**
- ✅ `te-kete-professional.css` (base)
- ✅ `ux-professional-enhancements.css` (polish)
- ✅ `mobile-polish.css` (mobile)
- ✅ `te-kete-professional.js`
- ✅ `ux-professional.js`
- ✅ `components.js`

### **Server:**
- ✅ Should be: **http://localhost:5173** (Vite)
- ❌ I mistakenly started port 8000 (stopped now)

## 🤝 MY CONTRIBUTION TODAY:

**Navigation Work (before consistency pass):**
- 561 files: Navigation standardization
- Lesson sequencing: 9 units, 92 lessons
- Breadcrumbs, SEO, accessibility
- **Status:** May overlap with Agent-9's 1,555 pages

**Confusion Created:**
- Started wrong server
- Created duplicate UX files
- Didn't read ground truth first
- **Learning:** Always check docs and GraphRAG FIRST!

## 🎯 READY FOR PROPER COLLABORATION:

**Next Actions:**
1. ✅ Synced with ground truth
2. ✅ Wrong server stopped
3. ⏳ Waiting for team direction
4. ⏳ Ready to support properly

**Questions for Team:**
- Does my 561-file navigation work overlap with the 1,555 consistency work?
- What navigation tasks still need doing?
- How can I support other agents' work without duplication?
