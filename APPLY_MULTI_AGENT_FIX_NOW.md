# üö® APPLY MULTI-AGENT ACCESS FIX NOW

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - BLOCKING ALL 12 AGENTS  
**Status:** Ready to apply  
**Time Required:** 5 minutes

---

## üéØ WHAT'S BROKEN

Recent security fix **accidentally broke multi-agent coordination**:
- ‚ùå Each agent can only see THEIR OWN data
- ‚ùå GraphRAG knowledge base is **siloed per agent**
- ‚ùå Agent coordination completely broken
- ‚ùå All 12 agents **cannot collaborate**

### Root Cause:
RLS policies now use `auth.uid()` which restricts tables to single-user access.  
GraphRAG and MCP tables need **shared multi-agent access**.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX (3 STEPS)

### STEP 1: DIAGNOSE (Optional - 30 seconds)

Run the diagnostic script to confirm the issue:

```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean
python3 execute-agent-access-fix.py
```

Expected output if broken:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  PROBLEM CONFIRMED: 2-4/4 tables blocked
```

---

### STEP 2: APPLY FIX VIA SUPABASE DASHBOARD (3 minutes)

**WHY DASHBOARD?**  
RLS policy changes require `service_role` key. The anon key used by agents cannot modify policies (security feature).

**HOW TO APPLY:**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
   - Login if needed

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar
   - Or go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq/sql

3. **Open New Query**
   - Click **"New Query"** button (top right)

4. **Copy Migration SQL**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251020_restore_multi_agent_access.sql`
   - Copy **ENTIRE contents** (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)

5. **Paste and Execute**
   - Paste into SQL Editor (Cmd+V)
   - Click **"Run"** button or press **Cmd+Enter**
   - Wait for execution (15-30 seconds)

6. **Check for Success**
   - Look for green checkmark ‚úÖ
   - Or scroll to bottom for completion message:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Multi-Agent Access Restored - October 20, 2025
     ```

---

### STEP 3: VERIFY FIX (30 seconds)

Run the test script to confirm all agents can now access GraphRAG:

```bash
python3 test-multi-agent-access.py
```

Expected output if fixed:
```
üéâ STATUS: ‚úÖ MULTI-AGENT ACCESS FULLY OPERATIONAL
   All agents can READ and WRITE to GraphRAG
```

---

## üìã WHAT THE FIX CHANGES

### Before (BROKEN):
```sql
-- RESTRICTIVE: Only auth.uid() can access
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own coordination logs" 
ON multi_ai_coordination_log
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);
```

### After (FIXED):
```sql
-- PERMISSIVE: All agents can access
CREATE POLICY "All agents can read coordination logs" 
ON multi_ai_coordination_log
FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Tables Fixed:
- ‚úÖ `resources` - All agents can read, authenticated can write
- ‚úÖ `relationships` - Full multi-agent access
- ‚úÖ `communities` - Full multi-agent access
- ‚úÖ `resource_concepts` - Full multi-agent access
- ‚úÖ `resource_embeddings` - Full multi-agent access
- ‚úÖ `multi_ai_coordination_log` - All agents read all logs
- ‚úÖ `agent_knowledge` - All agents share knowledge

### Tables Preserved (user-specific RLS unchanged):
- ‚úÖ `profiles` - Users still see only their own
- ‚úÖ `student_projects` - Students still see only their own
- ‚úÖ `user_saved_resources` - Users still see only their own

## üß™ MANUAL VERIFICATION (Alternative)

If you prefer to verify via SQL:

```sql
-- Check RLS policies on resources table
SELECT 
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    SUBSTRING(qual::text, 1, 50) as condition
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname='public' 
AND tablename IN ('resources', 'relationships', 'multi_ai_coordination_log')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

Expected policies:
- `All agents can read resources` with `USING (true)`
- `All agents can read relationships` with `USING (true)`
- `All agents can read coordination logs` with `USING (true)`

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Permission denied" in SQL Editor
**Solution:** Ensure you're logged in as project owner or have sufficient permissions.

### Problem: "Function exec_sql does not exist"
**Solution:** Supabase may not have this RPC. Apply SQL statements individually:
1. Copy one statement at a time
2. Execute each separately

### Problem: "Policy already exists"
**Solution:** This is expected - it means the policy is being replaced. Continue with remaining statements.

### Problem: Still getting access errors after applying
**Solution:** 
1. Check you're using the correct Supabase project
2. Clear any cached connections
3. Restart agent sessions
4. Re-run diagnostic: `python3 execute-agent-access-fix.py`

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE IMPACT

After applying this fix:
- ‚úÖ All 12 agents can access GraphRAG knowledge base
- ‚úÖ All agents can read each other's coordination logs
- ‚úÖ All agents can collaborate on shared resources
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent CSS/JS fixes can resume
- ‚úÖ All priority work can continue

## üìû NEED HELP?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `MULTI_AGENT_ACCESS_FIX.md` for detailed technical explanation
2. Review `execute-agent-access-fix.py` for diagnostic details
3. Verify Supabase project URL is correct
4. Ensure you have Dashboard access
