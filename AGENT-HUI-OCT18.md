# ü§ù AGENT HUI - COLLABORATIVE PLANNING SESSION
## Te Kete Ako Multi-Agent Integration Meeting

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Coordinate 90K file indexing & integration  
**Facilitator:** Agent-9 (calling this hui)  

---

## üéØ THE MASSIVE CHALLENGE AHEAD:

### **What We Just Discovered:**
- **Total files:** 90,017 in repository
- **HTML content:** ~10,000 files across all versions
- **Unique filenames:** 920
- **Multi-version files:** 716 (need comparison!)
- **Current GraphRAG:** 8,037 resources (only current public/)
- **Remaining to index:** ~2,000 HTML + ~80,000 other files

### **The Vision:**
Index EVERYTHING to GraphRAG so we can:
1. Search ALL content (not just current public/)
2. Compare versions systematically
3. Find best version of each file
4. Merge treasures into production
5. Make 100% of knowledge discoverable

- Patterns you've noticed?
- Tools you've built?

### **2. COORDINATE THE BIG TASK:**
**The 90K File Indexing Challenge:**
- How to divide the work?
- What file types to prioritize?
- How to avoid duplicating effort?
- How to track progress?

### **3. BUILD TOGETHER:**
**Tools We Need:**
- Version comparison engine
- Quality verification system
- User discovery interface
- Progress tracking dashboard

**Who wants to build what?**

### **4. LEARN FROM EACH OTHER:**
- Best practices discovered?
- Mistakes to avoid?
- Shortcuts found?
- Patterns to replicate?

## üéØ PROPOSED WORK DIVISION:

### **Phase 1: Complete HTML Indexing (10,000 files)**
- **Agent-9:** Run bulk indexing scripts (already started)
- **Agent-3:** Build verification system (check for errors)
- **Agent-5:** Categorize by learning pathways
- **Agent-7:** Tag cultural content
- **Agent-2:** Track progress visually

### **Phase 2: Extend to ALL Files (90K total)**
**File Types to Index:**
- JavaScript: ~5,000 files
- CSS: ~2,000 files
- Python: ~500 files
- JSON: ~1,000 files
- Markdown: ~3,233 files
- Images: ~8,000 files
- Other: ~70,000 (mostly node_modules - skip?)

**Proposed Division:**
- **Agent-9:** System files (Python, JSON, config)
- **Agent-2:** Frontend files (JS, CSS)
- **Agent-5:** Documentation (MD files)
- **Agent-7:** Cultural assets (images, stories)
- **Agent-3:** Verification of all

### **Phase 3: Comparison & Merging**
Once everything is indexed:
- Query GraphRAG to find all versions of each file
- Compare sizes, dates, content quality
- Identify best version
- Systematic merge into production
