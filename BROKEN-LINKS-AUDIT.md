## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **MAJOR ISSUE: browse.html is Missing (404)**

**Status:** ❌ **FILE NOT FOUND**

**Impact:** HIGH - This affects **30+ links** across the site, primarily in the main navigation

**Affected Files:**
- `index.html` - **30 occurrences** of broken links to `browse.html`

**Broken Link Examples:**
- Main navigation: `<a href="browse.html">📚 Ngā Rauemi Resources</a>`
- Subject filters: `browse.html?subject=english`, `browse.html?subject=math`, etc. (8 subjects)
- Year level filters: `browse.html?year=7` through `browse.html?year=13` (13 year levels)
- Footer links: Multiple "Browse All" links

**Recommended Fix:**

Option 1: Create `browse.html` as a comprehensive resource browser page  
Option 2: Replace all `browse.html` references with `resource-hub.html` (which exists but has loading errors)  
Option 3: Replace with specific pages:
- General browsing → `handouts.html` or `lessons.html`
- Subject browsing → keep query params but point to functional page
- Year level browsing → similar approach
