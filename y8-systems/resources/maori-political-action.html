                <div class="subtitle">Colonial Context:</div>
                <p>The Crown confiscated 1.6 million acres of Taranaki land after the Land Wars, violating Te Tiriti. Māori were left landless while settlers moved in.</p>

                <p>Te Whiti and Tohu Kākahi led Parihaka village in peaceful resistance. They used passive resistance, removing survey pegs and fences, and refusing to accept Crown authority over their land. They asserted tino rangatiratanga through non-violent political action.</p>

                <p>By 1975, Māori had lost 95% of their land through Crown policies. Land continued to be sold, breaking the connection between Māori and their ancestral whenua.</p>

                <p>Ngāti Whātua's ancestral land at Takaparawhau (Bastion Point) was gradually taken for military use, then planned for luxury housing development.</p>

                <p>Ngāti Whātua and supporters occupied their ancestral land for 507 days, establishing a village and asserting their mana whenua. They used traditional governance structures and tikanga to organize the occupation, demonstrating ongoing tino rangatiratanga.</p>

                <p>Though protestors were forcibly removed, the land was eventually returned to Ngāti Whātua in 1988. The occupation showed that Māori would continue to assert their sovereignty and connection to whenua.</p>

            <p><strong>Important Understanding:</strong> These actions are not "protests" against legitimate authority. They are Māori exercising their tino rangatiratanga and defending their sovereignty as guaranteed by Te Tiriti. From a Māori perspective, these are acts of legitimate political authority defending against colonial occupation.</p>
