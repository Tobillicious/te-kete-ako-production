            <p>For years, the old, empty lot at the end of High Street was an eyesore. For a group of friends—Mia, Leo, and Sarah—it was also a source of frustration. They loved to skateboard, but the closest skate park was a 30-minute bus ride away.</p>
            <p>They decided to do something. Their first step was to see if anyone else agreed. They created a petition and collected over 200 signatures. Their next step was to contact the people with power: the local council. Mia wrote a formal letter, and they were invited to speak at the next council meeting.</p>
            <p>The friends were nervous, but they explained how a skate park would provide a safe and healthy activity for young people. The council members were impressed. They voted to approve the project and fund the skate park. Six months later, the friends were the first to ride on the smooth concrete. They had learned that by understanding the system, they could make a real difference.</p>
