        <div class="case-study"><h2>The 1975 Land March - "Not One More Acre"</h2><p>In 1975, many Māori were angry that their land was still being taken and sold. Whina Cooper, who was nearly 80 years old, led a huge march (a hīkoi) from the Far North to Parliament in Wellington. Their message was "Not one more acre of Māori land should be sold." The march brought huge attention to the issue of Māori land rights.</p></div>
        <div class="case-study"><h2>The 1981 Springbok Tour - "The Tour of Shame"</h2><p>In 1981, the South African rugby team, the Springboks, toured New Zealand. At the time, South Africa had a racist system called Apartheid. Huge protests were organised across NZ to stop the games. Protestors felt it was wrong to play sports with a country that had such an unfair system. The country was divided, but the protests sent a powerful message against racism.</p></div>
        <div class="case-study"><h2>The Bastion Point Protest - "A Fight for Home"</h2><p>Bastion Point (Takaparawhau) is important land in Auckland for the iwi Ngāti Whātua. The government had taken most of it over many years. In 1977, protestors occupied the land for 507 days to stop it from being sold for expensive housing. Although the protestors were arrested, the protest raised public awareness, and the land was eventually returned to Ngāti Whātua.</p></div>
