        <div class="station-card"><h2>Station 1: Democracy</h2><p>In a democracy, the people hold the power. Citizens vote to elect leaders to represent them. If people don't like the decisions, they can vote for new leaders in the next election. <strong>Example:</strong> New Zealand.</p></div>
        <div class="station-card"><h2>Station 2: Monarchy</h2><p>A king or queen holds the power, which is passed down through their family. In a constitutional monarchy, an elected government makes most decisions. <strong>Example:</strong> United Kingdom.</p></div>
        <div class="station-card"><h2>Station 3: Dictatorship</h2><p>One person (a dictator) has absolute power. They often take power by force and do not hold fair elections. Citizens have very few rights. <strong>Example:</strong> North Korea.</p></div>
        <div class="station-card"><h2>Station 4: Communism</h2><p>The government owns and controls everything. The goal is a society where everyone is equal and wealth is shared. In practice, a single political party holds all the power. <strong>Example:</strong> China.</p></div>
        <div class="station-card"><h2>Station 5: Iwi-Based Leadership</h2><p>Traditionally, Māori society was organised into iwi and hapū. Decisions were made collectively by the community, led by rangatira (chiefs) and kaumātua (elders). <strong>Example:</strong> Local iwi in Aotearoa.</p></div>
