```

### 7. Orphaned/Duplicate Features
```
my-kete.html (use my-kete-enhanced.html OR my-kete-guest.html)
teacher-dashboard.html (old version, keep personalized)
student-dashboard.html (check which is better)
signup-teacher.html (use register.html with role detection)
signup-student.html (use register.html)
login-simple.html (use login.html)
register-simple.html (use register.html)
```

## Python Script Strategy

Create `cleanup-phase-1.py` that:
1. Lists all files to delete (for review)
2. Moves to `/archive/` instead of deleting (safety!)
3. Updates GraphRAG to mark as archived
4. Generates report of what was moved

## Expected Result

**Before:** 329 HTML files in `/public/`
**After:** ~50 essential HTML files in `/public/root`
**Archived:** ~280 files safely stored

## Next: Phase 2 will ORGANIZE the keepers into proper structure
