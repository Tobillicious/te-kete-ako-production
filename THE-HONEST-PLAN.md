# üéØ THE HONEST PLAN - After Socratic Interrogation

**Built on truth, not hype.**

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

**Assets:**
- 1,525 educational resources (HTML files)
- 621 marked "culturally integrated" (unvalidated)
- Supabase with GraphRAG structure (metadata graph)
- 123 vector embeddings (pgvector installed)
- AI orchestrator code (5 agents, unused)
- Existing teacher auth system

**Liabilities:**
- ‚ùå No validated quality metrics
- ‚ùå No validated cultural authority
- ‚ùå No user research (we don't know if teachers want this)
- ‚ùå No business model
- ‚ùå Poor search (keyword only)
- ‚ùå "Knowledge graph" is just metadata, not pedagogy

---

## üéØ WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO LEARN

### **Phase 0: VALIDATION (Before building anything)**

**Week 1: User Research**
```
Task: Talk to 10 real NZ teachers
Questions:
1. What's your biggest challenge finding lesson resources?
2. How do you currently find resources?
3. What makes a resource "good quality" for you?
4. Do you use TES? Twinkl? Why/why not?
5. How important is cultural integration? (scale 1-10)
6. Would you pay for quality NZ curriculum resources?
7. What would make you trust a resource platform?

Deliverable: User research doc with actual quotes, pain points, needs
Success criteria: Find at least ONE urgent, specific problem we can solve
```

**Week 2: Content Audit**
```
Task: Manually review 100 random resources
Evaluate:
1. Quality (scale 1-10)
2. Curriculum alignment (specific NZ curriculum links)
3. Usability (can a teacher use this tomorrow?)
4. Cultural appropriateness (does it mention MƒÅori content? If yes, flag for review)

Deliverable: Quality distribution chart
Success criteria: Know our actual quality baseline (not assumed 90+)
```

**Week 3: Cultural Partnership**
```
Task: Contact 3-5 MƒÅori educators or iwi education groups
Ask:
1. Would you review educational content for cultural appropriateness?
2. What would that process look like?
3. What are red flags for cultural harm?
4. Can we partner on this platform?

Deliverable: Cultural validation framework (or realization we can't do this alone)
Success criteria: Establish one real cultural partnership or advisor
```

**Decision Point: Do we proceed?**
- If user research shows no real need ‚Üí STOP
- If content audit shows <50% usable ‚Üí FIX FIRST
- If no cultural partnership ‚Üí CANNOT proceed with cultural claims

## üõ†Ô∏è WHAT WE ACTUALLY BUILD (Assuming validation passes)

### **MVP: The Simplest Thing That Could Work**

**Core Features (Week 4-6):**

```
1. SEARCH (Semantic)
   - Use existing pgvector
   - Generate embeddings for all 1,525 resources
   - Natural language search: "Y8 fractions MƒÅori"
   - Returns top 10 matches
   - That's it. No AI generation, no complexity.

2. BROWSE (Quality-filtered)
   - Grid of resources
   - Filter by: Subject, Year Level, Quality (only show validated ones)
   - Sort by: Quality, Recent, Most Used
   - That's it. No infinite scroll, no gamification.

3. RESOURCE PAGE (Simple)
   - The content (HTML)
   - Download PDF button
   - Print button
   - Save button (if logged in)
   - 3 related resources (GraphRAG, simplest relationships)
   - That's it. No AI enhancement, no 3D graph.

4. USER ACCOUNTS (Basic)
   - Supabase auth (already have it)
   - Saved resources list
   - That's it. No progress tracking, no achievements.

5. SUBSCRIPTION (Stripe)
   - Free: 5 views/week
   - Teacher ($12 NZD/month): Unlimited
   - School ($299 NZD/year): Unlimited teachers
   - That's it. No complex tiers.
```

**Technical Stack:**
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 (simple, fast, works)
Backend: Supabase (already set up)
Search: pgvector (already installed)
Payments: Stripe (standard)
AI: NONE in MVP (add later if needed)

Total new dependencies: ~5 (Next.js + Stripe)
Total complexity: LOW
Time to build: 2-3 weeks
Time to break: HIGH (simple = robust)
```

---

## üìä HOW WE VALIDATE SUCCESS

**Not metrics. OUTCOMES.**

**Success = Teachers use it and tell others**
- 10 active teachers in month 1
- 50 active teachers in month 3
- 5 unprompted testimonials
- 2 schools ask about school license

**Success ‚â† Engagement metrics**
- NOT: "Average session time 15 minutes"
- NOT: "10,000 page views"
- NOT: "50% save rate"

These metrics can be gamed. Actual teachers using it cannot be.

---

## üåø HOW WE HANDLE CULTURAL CONTENT

**Reality: We cannot AI-validate cultural appropriateness. Only MƒÅori educators can.**

**Process:**
```
1. Flag any resource with MƒÅori cultural content
2. Submit to cultural advisory board (real people)
3. They review for:
   - Authenticity
   - Cultural safety
   - Appropriateness
   - Permissions (if using specific iwi knowledge)
4. Only publish if approved
5. Credit cultural reviewers
6. Compensate their time (this is real work)

Timeline: As long as it takes
Compromise: ZERO
AI involvement: NONE
```

**If we cannot establish cultural advisory board:**
‚Üí Do NOT claim cultural integration
‚Üí Focus on general curriculum alignment only
‚Üí Be honest about limitations

---

## üéØ THE ACTUAL ROADMAP

**Phase 0: Validation (3 weeks)**
- Week 1: User research (10 teachers)
- Week 2: Content audit (100 resources)
- Week 3: Cultural partnership outreach

**Decision: Proceed or pivot?**

**Phase 1: MVP Build (3 weeks)**
- Week 4: Next.js setup + semantic search (pgvector)
- Week 5: Browse + resource pages + auth
- Week 6: Stripe integration + polish

**Phase 2: Beta Test (2 weeks)**
- Week 7: 3 teachers use it, we watch and listen
- Week 8: Iterate based on ACTUAL feedback

**Phase 3: Soft Launch (1 week)**
- Week 9: 10 teachers invited
- Observe, learn, fix

**Phase 4: Decide Next Steps**
- If teachers love it ‚Üí scale
- If teachers don't use it ‚Üí pivot or stop
- If cultural validation fails ‚Üí remove cultural claims

**Total: 9 weeks to know if this works**

---

## üö´ WHAT WE DO NOT BUILD (Yet)

**Not in MVP:**
- ‚ùå AI lesson generator
- ‚ùå Self-improving AI
- ‚ùå 5-agent orchestrator
- ‚ùå 3D knowledge graph
- ‚ùå Real-time enhancement
- ‚ùå Gamification
- ‚ùå Achievement badges
- ‚ùå Progress tracking
- ‚ùå Analytics dashboards
- ‚ùå Social features
- ‚ùå SuperDuperDB/PostgresML/MindsDB

**Why not?**
1. Not validated by user research
2. Adds complexity without proven value
3. Distracts from core problem: quality resources, easy to find
4. Can add later IF teachers ask for it

**Rule: If teachers don't explicitly ask for it, we don't build it.**

---

## üí° WHERE AI ACTUALLY HELPS (If at all)

**Option 1: Search only**
- Semantic search with embeddings (pgvector)
- That's it. Proven, simple, works.

**Option 2: Recommendations (if validated)**
- After 50+ teachers use platform
- Analyze what resources they actually use together
- Use PostgresML to find patterns
- Suggest based on REAL usage, not assumptions

**Option 3: Content generation (MAYBE, much later)**
- ONLY if:
  - We have 100% cultural validation process
  - Teachers explicitly ask for it
  - We can guarantee quality
  - Human review is mandatory
- Otherwise: NO

---

## ‚úÖ THE HONEST VISION

**Not:**
"Revolutionary AI-powered self-improving knowledge graph platform"

**But:**
"Quality NZ teaching resources, easy to find, culturally validated, actually useful."

**Boring? Maybe.**
**Useful? Definitely.**
**Sustainable? Yes.**
**Honest? Absolutely.**

---

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Draft user research questions** (ready for teacher interviews)
2. **Build content audit rubric** (how we'll evaluate 100 resources)
3. **Write cultural partnership proposal** (what we're asking for)
4. **Set decision criteria** (what would make us stop vs. proceed)

**No coding until validation passes.**

**This is the plan built on truth, not excitement.**

**Approve this?**
