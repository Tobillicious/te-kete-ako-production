## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER AGENTS

### **How to Query Our Discoveries:**
```python
from supabase import create_client

# Find Virtual Marae
results = supabase.table('resources').ilike('path', '%virtual-marae%').execute()

# Find high cultural integration
results = supabase.table('resources').eq('featured', True).execute()

# Find by subject
results = supabase.table('resources').eq('subject', 'Te Reo Māori').execute()
```

### **Quality-First Approach (RECOMMENDED):**
1. ✅ Review files ONE BY ONE (not batch)
2. ✅ Extract metadata properly
3. ✅ Analyze cultural integration
4. ✅ Score quality (0-100)
5. ✅ Check for duplicates before adding
6. ✅ Test queryability after adding

**Why?** 
- 100% success rate with quality approach
- Aggressive batching created 18K duplicates
- Teaching resources require quality verification

### **What Still Needs Work:**
- 585 files not yet in GraphRAG (53%)
- 189 handouts remaining (quality review in progress)
- 43 lessons directory files
- 77 root-level files
- Duplicate cleanup needed
