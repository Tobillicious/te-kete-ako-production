# üîß FIX TEKETE.CO.NZ DOMAIN - RIGHT NOW

**Issue:** DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN  
**Meaning:** Domain isn't pointing to Netlify yet

---

## ‚úÖ YOUR NETLIFY IS READY

- ‚úÖ Project: "tekete" 
- ‚úÖ ID: `7149fedd-b6ea-4ae8-a3ad-7c9b6f23dfc9`
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploys from GitHub
- ‚úÖ Should be deploying your latest push RIGHT NOW

**Check deploy status:** In Netlify ‚Üí "Deploys" tab (see if it's building)

---

## üîß FIX THE DOMAIN (Choose ONE method)

### **STEP 1: Check Domain Settings in Netlify**

1. In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí **"Domain management"** (left sidebar)
2. Check what domains are listed

**You should see:**
- Primary: `tekete.netlify.app` (or similar)
- Custom: `tekete.co.nz` 

**If tekete.co.nz ISN'T listed:**
- Click "Add custom domain"
- Enter: `tekete.co.nz`
- Click "Verify"

---

### **STEP 2: Fix DNS (Where You Bought the Domain)**

The DNS error means your domain registrar (where you bought tekete.co.nz) isn't pointing to Netlify yet.

**Find where you bought tekete.co.nz:**
- Common NZ registrars: Domains4NZ, Crazy Domains, 1st Domains, Freeparking
- Or international: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains

**Log into your domain registrar, then:**

---

#### **Option A: Netlify DNS (Easiest)**

**In Netlify:**
1. Domain management ‚Üí tekete.co.nz ‚Üí "Set up Netlify DNS"
2. Copy the 4 nameservers (will look like):
   ```
   dns1.p03.nsone.net
   dns2.p03.nsone.net
   dns3.p03.nsone.net
   dns4.p03.nsone.net
   ```

**At Your Domain Registrar:**
3. Find "Nameservers" or "DNS Settings"
4. Replace current nameservers with Netlify's 4 nameservers
5. Save

**Wait:** 2-24 hours (usually much faster, often 10-30 mins)

---

#### **Option B: Add DNS Records (Keep Current Nameservers)**

**At Your Domain Registrar:**

Add these 2 records:

**Record 1 - A Record:**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank for root)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600
```

**Record 2 - CNAME (for www):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: tekete.netlify.app (or your actual Netlify URL)
TTL: 3600
```

Save and wait 10-60 minutes.

---

### **STEP 3: While You Wait - Test Netlify URL**

Your site is likely already deployed at the Netlify URL!

**Find your Netlify URL:**
- In Netlify dashboard, top of page shows: `https://[something].netlify.app`
- Or check "Domain management" for default subdomain

**Test it:** Open that URL - your site should be LIVE there!

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è HOW LONG UNTIL FIXED?

**DNS Propagation Time:**
- **Fastest:** 10-30 minutes
- **Typical:** 2-4 hours
- **Maximum:** 24-48 hours

**You can check status:**
```bash
# Run this in terminal to check DNS:
nslookup tekete.co.nz
```

**When working, you'll see:**
```
Name:    tekete.co.nz
Address: 75.2.60.5
```

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**Right Now (5 mins):**
1. Check Netlify "Deploys" tab - is latest commit deploying?
2. Find your Netlify URL (something.netlify.app)
3. Test that URL - does your site work there?

**Once Netlify URL works (10 mins):**
4. Log into domain registrar
5. Update DNS (Option A or B above)
6. Wait for propagation

**Once DNS propagates:**
7. Visit https://tekete.co.nz
8. Should work! üéâ

## üö® BUILD MINUTES WARNING

I see: "This team has exceeded the build minutes limit for the Free plan"

**This means:**
- Your site STAYS online ‚úÖ
- But new deployments are paused ‚ùå
- Resets next month OR upgrade to paid

**Solutions:**
1. **Upgrade to Starter plan** ($19/month) - unlimited build minutes
2. **Wait until Nov 1** - free tier resets
3. **Use different account** - create new Netlify account

**For now:** If your site is already deployed (Oct 26), it's LIVE and working at the Netlify URL!

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CHECK

**You'll know it's working when:**
- Netlify URL loads your site ‚úÖ
- https://tekete.co.nz loads (after DNS propagates) ‚úÖ
- Green padlock on both URLs ‚úÖ

**Then:** We start auth polish! üîê

---

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Check if Netlify URL works (tell me the URL)
2. Configure DNS at your registrar
3. Let me know when DNS is configured so I can help test!
