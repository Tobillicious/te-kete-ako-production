# üß≠ **AGENT ONBOARDING - OCT 25, 2025**

Welcome to the Te Kete Ako transformation! This is your quick-start guide.

---

## ‚ö° **TL;DR - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW**

1. **Platform is LIVE** - https://tekete.netlify.app (production-ready v1.0.14)
2. **Team of 12 agents** - Each specializing in different domains
3. **Critical lesson**: **BUILD, DON'T DOCUMENT** - Make actual code changes, not coordination files
4. **Broken: NEVER use `run_terminal_cmd`** - Always use `mcp_supabase_execute_sql` instead
5. **Phase 4 COMPLETE** - Phase 5 (Scale & Polish) is underway NOW

- **Impact**: Recover ~1,200 additional resources
- **Skills**: Database operations, GraphRAG indexing
- **Pattern**: Files are ready, just need systematic processing
- **Team**: Autonomous work alongside Teams B/C

### **Choice 3: BUILD LEARNING CHAINS (6-8 hours)**
Scale from 3 chains to 20+ across all subjects
- **Impact**: Enable perfect learning pathways
- **Skills**: GraphRAG, relationship building, quality verification
- **Template**: Science Ecology (87.3 quality, 94% cultural) = reference standard
- **Team**: Collaborate with Team C

### **Choice 4: QUALITY PUSH (3-4 hours)**
Boost remaining Q88-89 pages to Q90+
- **Impact**: Get to 90%+ gold standard resources
- **Skills**: Content enrichment, cultural integration
- **Standard**: Science 97.8% cultural = benchmark
- **Team**: Work with Team B

## üîß **YOUR TOOLBOX**

### **Database Operations** (PRIMARY)
```sql
-- Query resources
SELECT * FROM resources WHERE subject = 'Mathematics' LIMIT 5;

-- Query relationships
SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships LIMIT 10;

-- Create relationships
INSERT INTO graphrag_relationships (source_path, target_path, relationship_type, confidence)
VALUES ('/lessons/y7-math.html', '/lessons/y8-math.html', 'builds_on', 0.95);
```

### **GraphRAG** (SECONDARY)
```sql
-- Index new resources
UPDATE graphrag_resources SET content_preview = '...' WHERE file_path = '...';

-- Check quality
SELECT file_path, quality_score, cultural_context FROM graphrag_resources 
WHERE quality_score < 90 ORDER BY quality_score DESC;
```

### **Website Pages** (HTML/CSS)
```html
<!-- Add to any page that needs nav -->
<script src="/components/navigation-standard.html" defer></script>

<!-- Apply professional styling -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/te-kete-professional.css">
```

---

## üö´ **CRITICAL DON'Ts**

### ‚ùå **NEVER do this:**
```bash
run_terminal_cmd (HANGS FOREVER!)
```

### ‚úÖ **DO THIS INSTEAD:**
```sql
mcp_supabase_execute_sql for all data operations
```

### ‚ùå **NEVER create coordination MDs**
The user said: "Stop creating coordination MDs - use ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md and agent_knowledge table"

### ‚úÖ **DO THIS:**
- Log discoveries to `agent_knowledge` table
- Track questions in `ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md`
- Commit actual code changes to git

---

## üìö **REFERENCE EXCELLENCE STANDARDS**

### **Science - Cultural Integration Model (97.8%)**
- Study: How science resources integrated mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori
- Apply: Same cultural framing to Mathematics/English

### **Digital Technologies Y8 (100% cultural, 298 resources)**
- Study: How Y8 achieved perfect cultural integration
- Scale: Apply this framework to other year levels

### **Ecology Y9 (99.4% cultural, 162 resources = MASTERY TIER)**
- Discovery: Y9 is where excellence peaks across all subjects
- Strategy: Build all chains WITH Y9 as mastery destination

### **Algebra Y9 (98.9% cultural = mastery tier)**
- Pattern: Matches Ecology discovery
- Template: Use Y9 excellence as foundation for chains

---

## üåø **CULTURAL INTEGRATION TARGETS**

**Already at 100%:**
- Social Studies: ‚úÖ 100%
- Digital Technologies: ‚úÖ 100%
- History: ‚úÖ 100%

**Growth Opportunities:**
- Science: 47% ‚Üí target 70% (use 97.8% model)
- Mathematics: 34% ‚Üí target 70% (use Y9 algebra model)
- English: 35% ‚Üí target 70% (build similar chains)

---

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE YOU'RE BUILDING ON**

### **Frontend (SOLID)**
- CSS: 5 consolidated files (professionalization, te-kete-professional, navigation, mobile, print)
- No duplicate navigation loads
- Singleton Supabase client (no memory leaks)
- WCAG AA accessibility throughout

### **Backend (EXCELLENT)**
- 20,942 resources indexed in GraphRAG
- 318,674 relationships at 0.84 avg confidence
- Zero orphaned pages
- Database: Health verified

### **Design System (BEAUTIFUL)**
- Kehinde Wiley-inspired aesthetic
- Cultural colors: Pounamu, Kahurangi, Whenua, Kowhai, Kumara
- Professional typography: Playfair + Inter
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)

## üìã **DAY 1 CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Read this file (5 min)
- [ ] Read DEPLOYMENT-SUCCESS-OCT25.md (10 min)
- [ ] Read ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md (5 min)
- [ ] Choose your mission (Choice 1/2/3/4 above)
- [ ] Query GraphRAG to understand data you'll be working with
- [ ] Ask Kaitiaki Aronui V3.0 (team lead) for clarification
- [ ] Make your first commit with actual code changes (not docs!)

---

## üí¨ **CRITICAL CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS AGENTS**

### **What Worked:**
‚úÖ Subject consolidation (141 ‚Üí 12 canonical) - Zero data loss
‚úÖ Cultural enrichment (1,127+ resources, +36% cultural gain)
‚úÖ Learning chains (3 perfect at confidence 1.0)
‚úÖ CSS sweep (99.9% coverage)
‚úÖ Team coordination through MCP + agent_knowledge table

### **What Didn't Work:**
‚ùå Creating 400+ coordination markdown files (waste of time)
‚ùå Multiple agents with divergent fixes (conflicts)
‚ùå Not using Playwright for visual testing (missed bugs)
‚ùå terminal_cmd hanging (don't use it!)

---

## üéì **KNOWLEDGE BASE QUERIES**

### **Understand Subject Consolidation:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM subject_consolidation_map LIMIT 12;
SELECT * FROM canonical_subjects ORDER BY order_priority;
```

### **Explore Learning Chains:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM graphrag_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type IN ('builds_on', 'extends_to', 'applies_to')
LIMIT 20;
```

### **Find Q88-89 Pages to Boost:**
```sql
SELECT file_path, title, quality_score FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE quality_score BETWEEN 88 AND 89
ORDER BY quality_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Discover Orphaned Pages (If Any):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM graphrag_resources
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT source_path FROM graphrag_relationships)
AND id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT target_path FROM graphrag_relationships)
LIMIT 10;
```
