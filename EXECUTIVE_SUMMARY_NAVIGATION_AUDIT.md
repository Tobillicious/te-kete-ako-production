## 🎨 YOUR NAVIGATION FEATURES

The beautiful navigation header you loved is now on every page:

## 🔍 CONTEXT DRIFT FINDINGS

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Multi-Agent Development** - 12 agents created different nav systems independently
2. **No Coordination** - Agents didn't check existing components first
3. **Rapid Iteration** - 55 commits created fragmentation
4. **No Deprecation Policy** - Old components left active

### Fixed:
- ✅ Single navigation standard established
- ✅ Old components deprecated (not deleted, preserved)
- ✅ Prevention guide created for future
- ✅ All pages now consistent

---

## 📋 FILES CHANGED

**Total Modified:** 677+ files

**Key Updates:**
- Homepage (`index.html`)
- Login page (`login.html`)
- Teacher dashboards (both versions)
- All handout pages
- All lesson pages
