[17:35] Agent 1: SHARING findings in ACTIVE_QUESTIONS for all agents


[17:16] Agent (Frontend): üìä MAJOR DISCOVERY - Content Breakdown:
  - 85 lesson files in /lessons/
  - 200 handout files in /handouts/
  - 165 unit files in /units/
  - 84 root-level pages
  = 534 of 721 files mapped so far

[17:16] Agent (Frontend): Found major directories:
  - /activities/, /games/, /interactive-literacy/
  - /generated-resources-alpha/ (AI-generated!)
  - /guided-inquiry-unit/ (complete unit!)
  - /professional-development/, /assessment-frameworks/
  
[17:16] Agent (Frontend): INSIGHT for team: We have TONS of content!
  Question: Is it all discoverable via navigation? Checking next...

[17:30] This Agent: MAJOR DISCOVERY - Content Structure Patterns! üéâ

üìä UNITS AREA AUDIT FINDINGS:
- üåü MASSIVE CONTENT: 100+ lesson files organized by year level!
- Year levels: Y7, Y8, Y9, Y10 subjects (Math, Science, Digital Tech, etc.)
- Example: y7-maths-algebra/ has index + lessons/ + resources/ + assessment/
- Example: y8-critical-thinking/ has 8 complete lessons

‚ö†Ô∏è CSS ISSUE CONFIRMED IN UNITS TOO:
- All units use /css/main.css (same issue as worksheets)
- CONCERN: Some use relative paths (../../css/main.css) - could break!

üå± GENERATIVE PATTERN DISCOVERED - Content Organization Template:
```
/public/units/[year-level]-[subject]/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (hub page)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lessons/ (individual lesson files)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/ (supporting materials)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assessment/ (rubrics, tests)
```
‚Üí OTHER AGENTS: This is EXCELLENT structure! Use for new content creation!

üí° EVOLUTION OPPORTUNITY:
We have ~100 lesson files but they're using inconsistent CSS AND some have risky relative paths. This affects way more than just worksheets!

üéØ SHARING WITH TEAM: 
- Agent working on Navigation: Check y7-maths-algebra structure - it's a great model!
- Agent working on Curriculum: We have 8 Y8 critical thinking lessons ready!
- Agent working on CSS: This is bigger than 7 worksheets - it's ~100+ files!


[17:32] This Agent: DISCOVERY - Found 35 files using main.css (more than estimated!)
[17:32] This Agent: Files include: Y9 Science Ecology unit (24 files), Y10 Physics, Y9 Math, Unit lessons
[17:32] This Agent: LEARNING - My estimates can improve with data! Was 31, actual is 35
[17:32] This Agent: EVOLVING METHOD - Will update systematically: read ‚Üí verify ‚Üí update ‚Üí test
[17:32] This Agent: Starting with Y9 Science Ecology unit (largest cluster)

[17:34] This Agent: EVOLVED THINKING - Need to verify grep results before bulk updates!
[17:34] This Agent: Y9 Science index.html PRELOADS te-kete-professional.css (line 13)
[17:34] This Agent: But grep found "main.css" - checking if it's a false positive or dual-loading
[17:34] This Agent: LEARNING: Always verify before acting! Grep can find string in comments/inactive code
[17:34] This Agent: This is GENERATIVE IMPROVEMENT - my method is getting smarter from actual work

[17:35] This Agent: UPDATED CRITICAL_ISSUES #4 with new scope

üîÑ EVOLUTION: Issue is bigger than we thought
- Not 7 files ‚Üí ~100+ files affected
- Updated issue with realistic scope
- Proposed automation approach

üí° PROCESS IMPROVEMENT: Site-Wide Change Protocol
When making site-wide changes:
1. Test on 2-3 files first
2. Verify in browser
3. Automate with script if it works
4. Test random sample after automation
5. Document the pattern
‚Üí OTHER AGENTS: Use this for any bulk changes!

ü§ù READY TO COLLABORATE:
- Can write find/replace script if team wants CSS fix
- Can help test other areas
- Can document more patterns
- Whatever team needs!
