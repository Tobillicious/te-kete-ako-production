### **CLOSING (Questions & Discussion)**

**Be ready for:**

**Q: "How much will this cost?"**
A: "About $15,000 over 18 months - mostly technical infrastructure. Development is AI-automated, so it's incredibly cost-effective. By month 18, we aim to be self-sustaining."

**Q: "Can teachers start using this now?"**
A: "Absolutely! All 1,488 resources are ready today. The pilot program in Phase 1 will gather feedback to improve further."

**Q: "How do you ensure the Māori content is appropriate?"**
A: "We plan to establish a Māori cultural advisory group in months 1-2. Current content is respectful and informed, but we seek ongoing community guidance."

**Q: "What if it doesn't work?"**
A: "Low risk - the platform is already built. Even if we don't scale, teachers have 1,488 free resources. But given the quality and need, I'm confident this will succeed."

**Q: "How is this different from other platforms?"**
A: "Three things: Authentic mātauranga Māori integration, 100% NZ-specific content, and AI-powered continuous improvement. We're not buying from overseas - we're building something uniquely Aotearoa."
