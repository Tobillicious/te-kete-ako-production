## 📊 VERIFICATION QUERIES

### **After execution, verify with:**

```sql
-- Query 1: Find all vision documents
SELECT title, type, quality_score, created_at
FROM resources
WHERE title LIKE '%Vision%' OR title LIKE '%BMAD%' OR title LIKE '%Roadmap%'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Query 2: See all vision relationships
SELECT 
  r1.title as source,
  rel.relationship_type,
  r2.title as target,
  rel.confidence_score,
  rel.metadata->>'insight' as insight
FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN resources r1 ON r1.id = rel.source_resource_id
JOIN resources r2 ON r2.id = rel.target_resource_id
WHERE rel.relationship_type LIKE '%vision%'
   OR rel.relationship_type LIKE '%philosophy%'
   OR rel.relationship_type LIKE '%fulfills%'
ORDER BY rel.confidence_score DESC;

-- Query 3: Trace from Grand Vision to current
SELECT 
  r1.title as from_doc,
  rel.relationship_type,
  r2.title as to_doc,
  r1.created_at::date as from_date,
  r2.created_at::date as to_date,
  (r2.created_at - r1.created_at) as days_between
FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN resources r1 ON r1.id = rel.source_resource_id
JOIN resources r2 ON r2.id = rel.target_resource_id
WHERE r1.title LIKE '%Grand Vision%'
ORDER BY r2.created_at;
```

## 🤝 TEAM COLLABORATION BENEFITS

### **After Insertion, All Agents Can:**

**1. Query Vision History:**
```sql
-- Find original planning for current feature
SELECT * FROM resources 
WHERE title LIKE '%Teacher Experience%'
  OR title LIKE '%Student Experience%'
  OR title LIKE '%Sidebar%';
```

**2. Trace Dependencies:**
```sql
-- Find what KAMAR integration blocks
SELECT r2.title, rel.metadata
FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN resources r1 ON r1.id = rel.source_resource_id
JOIN resources r2 ON r2.id = rel.target_resource_id
WHERE r1.title LIKE '%KAMAR%'
  AND rel.relationship_type LIKE '%dependency%';
```

**3. Understand "Older Better Style":**
```sql
-- Find BMAD design philosophy
SELECT title, description, metadata
FROM resources
WHERE title LIKE '%BMAD%';

-- See what BMAD connects to
SELECT r2.title, rel.metadata->>'insight'
FROM graphrag_relationships rel
JOIN resources r1 ON r1.id = rel.source_resource_id
JOIN resources r2 ON r2.id = rel.target_resource_id
WHERE r1.title LIKE '%BMAD%';
```

**4. Validate Timeline:**
```sql
-- See if current work aligns with roadmap
SELECT 
  title,
  metadata->>'current_week' as week,
  metadata->>'current_phase' as phase
FROM resources
WHERE title LIKE '%Roadmap%';
```

## 🎊 IMPACT ON TEAM COLLABORATION

### **Before Insertion:**
- ❌ Agents don't know about BMAD (Aug 5)
- ❌ Agents don't know sidebar was always planned
- ❌ Agents don't know we're Week 12 (Phase 3)
- ❌ Agents don't know KAMAR is blocker
- ❌ Work duplicated or contradicts vision

### **After Insertion:**
- ✅ All agents see complete vision genealogy
- ✅ All agents know BMAD is "older better style"
- ✅ All agents understand 89-day timeline
- ✅ All agents see KAMAR blocker
- ✅ Work coordinates perfectly!
