## 🚨 AUTHENTICATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **Problem 1: RLS Policies Blocking Signup**

**Error:** `500 Internal Server Error` on signup  
**Cause:** Row Level Security rejecting profile creation  

**Fix Prepared:**
- File: `AUTH-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- SQL ready to execute
- **Needs:** Manual run in Supabase dashboard (MCP is read-only)

**Steps:**
```
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq/sql
2. Paste SQL from AUTH-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md
3. Run it
4. Test signup
```

### **Problem 2: Multiple Conflicting Auth Files**

**Conflicts Found:**
```
./public/js/supabase-auth.js (old)
./public/js/supabase-client.js (complex)
./public/js/auth-unified.js (NEW - created tonight)
./backups/ - 7+ legacy auth files
```

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Created `/public/js/auth-unified.js` - single source of truth
⏳ Need to update HTML files to use it
⏳ Remove old files after testing

## 🔧 OTHER HIGH-LEVEL CONFLICTS

### **1. Duplicate Meta Tags**
**File:** `/public/login.html`
- Has duplicate `viewport` meta tags

**Status:** Most pages standardized, few edge cases remain
