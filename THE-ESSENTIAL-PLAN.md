# 🎯 THE ESSENTIAL PLAN - Quality Over Everything

**Stop planning. Start building what matters.**

---

## ✨ **THE CORE IDEA (3 sentences)**

1. **Teachers need quality resources fast** - Browse by subject/year, filter by quality, find what they need in 30 seconds
2. **Make it gorgeous** - Kehinde Wiley aesthetic, smooth as butter, respect their time
3. **SaaS basics** - Auth, subscriptions, save resources, that's it

---

## 🎯 **WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS**

### **Must Have (Week 1-2):**
```
1. Next.js setup + Supabase auth + Stripe
2. Beautiful homepage (one hero image, search bar, that's it)
3. Browse page (grid, 2 filters: subject + year, done)
4. Resource page (content + save button + download PDF)
5. Dashboard (saved resources list, nothing else)
```

### **Nice to Have (Week 3-4):**
```
1. Collections (group saved resources)
2. Recommendations (GraphRAG: "Similar resources")
3. Search (Cmd+K)
```

### **Don't Need (Ever):**
```
❌ Achievement badges
❌ Streak tracking  
❌ Analytics dashboards
❌ Gamification
❌ Social features
❌ Trending sections
❌ 15 different widgets
```

**Why?** Teachers aren't gamers. They want resources, not engagement metrics.

## 🎨 **THE ACTUAL DESIGN**

### **Homepage:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TE KETE AKO                  [Login]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
│                                     │
│   Beautiful Kehinde Wiley hero     │
│   "Find quality NZ teaching         │
│    resources in seconds"            │
│                                     │
│   [Search resources...]             │
│   or                                │
│   [Browse by Subject ▾]             │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

That's it. No bloat.

### **Browse Page:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Units (1,525 resources)             │
│                                     │
│ [Subject ▾] [Year ▾] [90+ Quality ✓]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
│                                     │
│ Grid of beautiful cards             │
│ Click → Resource page               │
│ No pagination, just results         │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Fast. Clean. Done.

### **Resource Page:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Y8 Geometry & Kōwhaiwhai Patterns  │
│ Math • Year 8 • 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟         │
│                                     │
│ [💾 Save] [📥 Download] [🖨️ Print]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
│                                     │
│ THE ACTUAL CONTENT                  │
│ (Let it breathe, no clutter)        │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
│ Related: 3 links (GraphRAG)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Content is king.

## 💡 **THE ONE CLEVER THING**

**GraphRAG-powered "Related Resources"**

Not 15 recommendation widgets. Just 3 smart links at the bottom:
- Prerequisite (what comes before)
- Next step (what comes after)  
- Related (same concept, different angle)

**That's the intelligence.** Subtle, helpful, not overwhelming.

---

## 🔐 **SaaS Essentials (Not Extras)**

├─ 14 days
├─ No credit card
├─ Full access

## ✅ **THE QUALITY CHECKLIST**

Every feature must answer YES to all:
1. **Does a teacher actually need this?**
2. **Does it save them time?**
3. **Can I build it in < 1 week?**
4. **Will it still work in 5 years?**

If any NO → cut it.

---

## 🎯 **THE TRANSFORMATIVE BIT**

**It's not the features. It's the quality of the resources.**

We have:
- 1,525 resources
- 1,525 gold quality (90+)
- GraphRAG relationships verified
- Cultural integration tracked

**The platform just needs to get out of the way.**

Beautiful design + fast search + quality content = teachers happy.

That's it.

**This is the real plan. Should I start building THIS?**
