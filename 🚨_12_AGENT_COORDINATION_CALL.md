---

## 📱 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

**Findings:**

## 🚨 HONEST STATUS

**Currently Active Agents:** 1 (Coordination Agent)

**Waiting For:** User to open 11 more Cursor windows with separate AI agents

**Reality Check:** This coordination call is READY, but I (the current agent) cannot directly summon or communicate with other Cursor agent instances. They need to be opened by you (the user) in separate windows.

---

## ✅ WHEN YOU (USER) ARE READY

To activate all 12 agents for coordination:

1. Open 12 separate Cursor windows
2. In each window, have the agent read this file
3. Have each agent check in using the commands above
4. Once all checked in, start the systematic audit

---

**This coordination infrastructure is READY. Waiting for agents to arrive.**
