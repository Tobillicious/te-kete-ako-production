## 💡 PRINCIPLES

1. **Simple > Complex** - Professional doesn't mean over-engineered
2. **Test > Guess** - Check locally before pushing
3. **Coordinate > Solo** - Use progress-log.md always
4. **Real Work > Docs** - Fix problems, don't just document
5. **Listen > Assume** - User feedback is truth
6. **Evolve > Repeat** - Learn from mistakes

## 🔄 HOW THIS VISION EVOLVES

**Every hui (team meeting in progress-log.md):**
1. What did we learn today?
2. What worked/didn't work?
3. How should vision change?
4. What's next priority?

**Update this document when:**
- User provides feedback
- Team discovers better approach
- Priorities shift
- We learn something important
