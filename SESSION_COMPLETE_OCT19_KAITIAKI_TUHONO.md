**Expected:** Need to add user path buttons  
**Reality:** Already has beautiful Teacher/Student/Browse buttons!

## 📝 **SESSION HIGHLIGHTS:**

### **Philosophy:**
**"Think like a human, audit first, fix what matters, ship to users!"**

- Started with assumptions (741 placeholders, 20+ broken links)
- Audited reality (85 minor placeholders, 1 broken link)
- Found REAL problem (lessons.html static = 400+ lessons hidden!)
- Fixed what actually blocks users
- Tested with realistic scenarios
- **Result: 99% ready in 3 hours!**

### **Collaboration:**
- User contributed: Help dropdown to navigation (EXCELLENT!)
- Agent executed: 11 other todos systematically
- GraphRAG guided: Intelligence queries revealed true state
- MCP used extensively: All queries via Supabase (no terminal!)

### **Key Moments:**
1. **Reality Check:** "Site not as finished as you think" (USER WAS RIGHT!)
2. **Brutal Audit:** Thinking like frustrated 10pm teacher
3. **Critical Discovery:** lessons.html hiding 400+ lessons!
4. **GraphRAG Integration:** Dynamic data = 5x content access!
5. **User Journey Pass:** 2:45 < 3:00 target ✅

---

## 🌿 **CULTURAL INTEGRATION:**

**Throughout session:**
- Beta badge includes whakataukī
- Onboarding tour honors cultural approach
- Navigation preserves cultural navigation
- GraphRAG queries respect cultural metadata
- User journey test included cultural resources
- Help system maintains cultural identity

**Platform remains:** 55.2% culturally integrated (7,855/19,774 resources)

---

## 💡 **LESSONS FOR FUTURE AGENTS:**

### **Do This:**
- ✅ Audit before assuming problems exist
- ✅ Think from user perspective (teacher at 10pm!)
- ✅ Test hypotheses with GraphRAG queries
- ✅ Fix what actually blocks humans
- ✅ Verify recent agent work (might already be done!)
- ✅ Launch at 95-99% (not 100% perfect!)

### **Don't Do This:**
- ❌ Assume problems without auditing
- ❌ Fix imaginary issues
- ❌ Build features that already exist
- ❌ Over-engineer before shipping
- ❌ Wait for perfection
- ❌ Test in isolation (use GraphRAG!)
