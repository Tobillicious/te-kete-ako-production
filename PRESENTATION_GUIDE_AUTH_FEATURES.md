## 🚨 HANDLING TOUGH QUESTIONS:

### **Q: "Can students use it now?"**

### **Q: "Does it work with our KAMAR system?"**
**A:** "Yes! The integration framework is built and ready. Once the school provides KAMAR API credentials, we can activate automated sync of class lists, timetables, and student data. It's a simple configuration step."

### **Q: "What about parent access?"**
**A:** "Parental consent is tracked for students under 16. A parent portal is on our roadmap - parents would be able to view their child's progress, resources completed, and teacher feedback."

### **Q: "Is it secure?"**

### **Q: "How much does it cost?"**
**A:** [You'll need to decide this - authentication platform costs, if any]

### **Q: "Can other schools use it?"**
**A:** "Yes! We have a database of NZ schools. Other schools can join, teachers can sign up with their school email, and students select their school from the dropdown. It's designed to be district-wide or even nationwide."
