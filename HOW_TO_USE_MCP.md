# üîß HOW TO USE MCP FOR AGENT COORDINATION
## Model Context Protocol Setup

**User instruction:** "Use the MCP"  
**Problem:** We don't know HOW to use it for coordination!

---

## üéØ WHAT WE HAVE

**MCP Server Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq"
    }
  }
}
```

**Location:** `.cursor/mcp_config.json`

## ‚ùì WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

**Questions for User:**

1. **How do agents actually query the MCP server?**
   - Do we make HTTP requests to the URL?
   - Is there a special tool/API?
   - Do we use it through Cursor interface?

2. **What can we store/retrieve from MCP?**
   - Agent coordination state?
   - Shared knowledge?
   - File versions?
   - Design decisions?

3. **How does it help prevent our current problems?**
   - Would it stop us from over-writing each other?
   - Could it store "good version" of index.html?
   - Can it track which agent is working on what?

4. **Is there documentation?**
   - MCP protocol docs?
   - Supabase MCP usage examples?
   - How other teams use this?

## üí° HOW IT COULD HELP (If we knew how to use it)

**Coordination Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Store shared state (who's working on what)
- ‚úÖ Version tracking (which index.html was good)
- ‚úÖ Agent communication (real-time updates)
- ‚úÖ Prevent conflicts (lock files being edited)
- ‚úÖ Knowledge sharing (successful patterns)

**For Index.html specifically:**
- Store user-approved versions
- Track which commits were rejected/approved
- Lock file when one agent is editing
- Share design decisions across agents

---

## ü§î CURRENT STATE

**What we're doing:**
- Using MD files for coordination (progress-log.md, AGENT_COORDINATION.md)
- Git commits for sharing work
- But: No real-time coordination, lots of conflicts

**What MCP could enable:**
- Real-time agent status
- Shared decision database
- File locking
- Version approval tracking

---

## üìã REQUEST FOR USER

**Please teach us how to use MCP:**

1. How do we query the MCP server?
2. What endpoints/methods are available?
3. Can you show an example of storing/retrieving data?
4. How should we structure our coordination data?

**Or point us to:**
- MCP documentation
- Example usage
- Tutorial for Cursor agents

## üéØ PROPOSED MCP SCHEMA (If we could use it)

```
Agents Table:
- agent_id (which agent)
- current_task (what they're working on)
- status (active/idle)
- last_update (timestamp)

Files Table:
- file_path (e.g. public/index.html)
- locked_by (which agent is editing)
- good_version_commit (user-approved version)
- last_rejected_commit (what didn't work)

Decisions Table:
- decision_id
- question (e.g. "Which index design?")
- votes (agent responses)
- resolved (yes/no)
- final_decision
```

**Status:** üü° AWAITING USER GUIDANCE

**This Agent:** Ready to learn and implement MCP coordination!

**Other Agents:** If you know how to use MCP, please share!
