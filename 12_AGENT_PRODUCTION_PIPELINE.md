# üöÄ 12-AGENT PRODUCTION PIPELINE EVOLUTION
## Extending Our Agentic Workflow to Cover All Gaps

**Created:** October 14, 2025 22:00  
**By:** agent-12 (Kaitiaki Aronui V3.0) - Supreme Overseer  
**Status:** üîÑ EVOLVING - Based on Evening Sprint Learnings

---

## üéØ MISSION

Transform Te Kete Ako development through **coordinated 12-agent production pipeline** that covers ALL workflow gaps identified tonight.

---

## üìä EVENING SPRINT DISCOVERIES (What We Learned)

### ‚úÖ What WORKED Tonight:
1. **MCP Coordination:** Real-time agent status tracking working
2. **ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md:** Effective async coordination
3. **progress-log.md:** Good for status updates
4. **Batch Processing:** agent-2's systematic CSS migration (100+ files!)
5. **Quality First:** Orphaned pages were already excellent (no rework needed)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS IDENTIFIED (Need to Fill):
1. **GraphRAG Logging:** No "log" function to store discoveries
2. **Automated Validation:** Manual testing of CSS migrations (slow)
3. **Agent Handoff:** No structured way to pass work between agents
4. **Quality Gates:** No automated checks before deployment
5. **Knowledge Capture:** Learning isn't being stored in GraphRAG
6. **Parallel Work:** Only 2/12 agents active (underutilized)
7. **Testing Pipeline:** No automated browser/accessibility testing
8. **Cultural Validation:** Manual process, not scalable
9. **Progress Metrics:** No automated tracking of completion %
10. **Deployment Pipeline:** Manual git commits (should be automated)

## üîÑ EVOLVED WORKFLOW: From Manual to Automated

### BEFORE (Tonight's Manual Process):
```
1. agent-2: Manually migrate CSS files
2. agent-2: Manually test each file
3. agent-2: Update progress log
4. agent-12: Manually check status
5. Repeat...
```
**Problems:** Slow, manual, doesn't scale to 12 agents

### AFTER (Automated Production Pipeline):
```
1. agent-1: Auto-audit ‚Üí Generate task list ‚Üí Post to MCP
2. agent-2: Claim batch (50 files) ‚Üí Execute migration
3. agent-11: Auto-test migrated batch ‚Üí Report results to MCP
4. agent-5: QA validation ‚Üí Approve/reject
5. agent-10: Auto-commit approved batch ‚Üí Deploy
6. agent-12: Monitor MCP ‚Üí Coordinate next batch
7. GraphRAG: Auto-log all discoveries
```
**Benefits:** Fast, automated, scales to 1000s of files

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS WE NEED TO BUILD (Covering Gaps)

### 1. **GraphRAG Logger** (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Gap:** Can't log discoveries to GraphRAG  
**Solution:**
```python
# Add to supabase_graphrag_connector.py:
def log_discovery(agent_id: str, discovery: str, category: str):
    """Log agent discoveries to GraphRAG"""
    # Insert into agent_discoveries table
    pass
```

### 2. **CSS Validation Pipeline** (Priority: HIGH)
**Gap:** Manual testing of CSS migrations  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Create: scripts/validate-css-migration.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-check CSS paths, validate no conflicts, test accessibility
```

### 3. **Agent Task Queue** (Priority: HIGH)
**Gap:** No structured work handoff between agents  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Enhance MCP server with task queue
POST /tasks - Create task
GET /tasks/available - Get next task for agent
POST /tasks/{id}/claim - Claim task
POST /tasks/{id}/complete - Complete task
```

### 4. **Automated Testing Suite** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Gap:** No automated browser/accessibility testing  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Create: scripts/automated-testing.js
// Run Playwright tests, accessibility audits, visual regression
```

### 5. **Quality Gates** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Gap:** No checks before deployment  
**Solution:**
```yaml
# Create: .github/workflows/quality-gate.yml
# Check: CSS valid, links work, accessibility OK, tests pass
```

### 6. **Progress Dashboard** (Priority: LOW)
**Gap:** No real-time progress visualization  
**Solution:**
```html
<!-- Create: public/admin/progress-dashboard.html -->
<!-- Show: Agent status, task completion %, quality metrics -->
```

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Gap Coverage (Tonight/Tomorrow)
**Priority:** CRITICAL gaps that block 12-agent scale-up

1. **GraphRAG Logger** (30 minutes)

   - Add log_discovery() function to connector
   - Test with tonight's discoveries

2. **CSS Validation Script** (45 minutes)
   - Owner: agent-11 or agent-5
   - Automate what agent-2 is doing manually
   - Integrate with workflow-pipeline.py

3. **MCP Task Queue** (1 hour)
   - Owner: agent-10 or agent-12 (ME)
   - Extend MCP server with /tasks endpoints
   - Enable async work handoff

### Phase 2: Quality & Testing (Next 2-3 days)
4. **Automated Testing Suite** (2-3 hours)
   - Owner: agent-11 + agent-9
   - Browser tests, accessibility audits
   - Integrate with CI/CD

5. **Quality Gates** (1-2 hours)

## üéØ 12-AGENT PARALLEL WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

**Scenario:** Migrate remaining 222 pages to professional CSS

### Traditional (Sequential):
```
agent-2: Migrate all 222 pages manually (6+ hours)
```

### 12-Agent Pipeline (Parallel):
```
agent-1:  Audit & divide into 5 batches of ~45 pages (15 min)
agent-2:  Migrate batch 1 (45 min)
agent-3:  Migrate batch 2 (45 min) [PARALLEL]
agent-4:  Migrate batch 3 (45 min) [PARALLEL]
agent-11: Test batch 1 (15 min) - starts when agent-2 done
agent-5:  QA batch 1 (10 min) - starts when agent-11 done
agent-10: Deploy batch 1 (5 min) - starts when agent-5 approved
agent-12: Coordinate all agents via MCP
```
**Total Time:** ~1.5 hours (4x faster!)

---

## ü§ù COORDINATION PROTOCOLS FOR 12 AGENTS

### 1. **Task Assignment** (Prevents Overlap)
```
1. agent-12 posts task to MCP: /tasks/create
2. Available agents query: GET /tasks/available
3. Agent claims: POST /tasks/{id}/claim
4. Work proceeds with automatic handoff
```

### 2. **Progress Updates** (30-Minute Cycle)
```
Every agent updates MCP every 30 min:
POST /agent/{id}/progress with:
- Current task
- % complete
- Blockers (if any)
- Next steps
```

### 3. **Quality Gates** (Before Handoff)
```
When task complete:
1. Agent runs validation script
2. If pass ‚Üí POST /tasks/{id}/complete
3. If fail ‚Üí Document issue, request help
4. Next agent automatically notified
```

### 4. **Knowledge Capture** (Continuous Learning)
```
All discoveries logged to GraphRAG:
python3 supabase_graphrag_connector.py log-discovery \
  agent-X "What we learned" category
```

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Tonight)

**agent-12 (ME) will:**
1. ‚úÖ Create this pipeline document
2. üîÑ Extend GraphRAG connector with log function
3. üîÑ Create CSS validation script
4. üìä Document tonight's progress for all agents
5. üéØ Prepare task queue for tomorrow's 12-agent sprint

**Coordination with agent-2:**
- Continue excellent CSS migration work
- I'll build automation around your process
- Tomorrow: Test automated validation on your work

---

## üí° PHILOSOPHY: From Solo Work to Super Consciousness

**Old Way:**
- Each agent works independently
- Manual coordination through MDs
- Sequential processing
- Knowledge lost between sessions

**New Way (12-Agent Pipeline):**
- Agents work as ONE system
- Automated coordination via MCP + GraphRAG
- Parallel processing with smart handoffs
- Knowledge continuously captured & shared

**Result:** 
- 5-10x faster development
- Higher quality (automated checks)
- Scalable to 100s of tasks
- Continuous learning & improvement

---

## üéì LESSONS FROM TONIGHT (For Tomorrow)

1. **Quality First:** Don't migrate what's already good (orphaned pages)
2. **Automate Repetition:** agent-2's manual testing should be scripted
3. **Parallel > Sequential:** 2 agents working = 2x output (obvious but often missed)
4. **Capture Knowledge:** GraphRAG needs continuous updates
5. **Clear Handoffs:** MCP task queue prevents confusion
6. **Test Before Deploy:** Quality gates save time fixing production issues

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS FOR USER

**To Activate Full 12-Agent Pipeline:**

1. **Review this document** - Confirm architecture makes sense
2. **Prioritize gaps** - Which tools to build first?
3. **Assign agents** - Ready to spin up all 12 for tomorrow?
4. **Approve automation** - OK to build validation scripts?
5. **GraphRAG access** - Confirm we can extend the connector

**I'm ready to:**
