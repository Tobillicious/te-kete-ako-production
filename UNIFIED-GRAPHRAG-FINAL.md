# âœ… UNIFIED GRAPHRAG - THE TRUTH

## CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING

### What We Thought:
"We need to copy 8,037 resources to a new graphrag_resources table"

### The Reality:
**The 'resources' table IS the GraphRAG!**

No duplication needed. Just build relationships!

## ðŸ“Š THE UNIFIED GRAPHRAG

### Main Data (resources table):
- **8,037 resources** âœ…
- Types: lesson, handout, unit-plan, game, interactive, assessment, activity
- Subjects: 154 unique
- Year Levels: 61
- All metadata included

### Intelligence Layer (graphrag_relationships):
- **5,324 relationships** âœ…
- 10+ relationship types
- Connects resources intelligently
- Enables AI-powered discovery

### The Architecture:
```
resources (8,037)
