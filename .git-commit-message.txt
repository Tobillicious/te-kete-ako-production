📚 Create Master Knowledge Base - Synthesize All Documentation

🎯 Major Change: Unified Documentation System

Created TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md - the single source of truth for all agents across all models, continuously updated.

📝 What This Accomplishes:
- Synthesizes all scattered .md files into ONE living document
- Provides complete system overview for any agent joining project
- Includes current status, architecture, strategic plan, and learnings
- Dialectical approach: shows what was tried, what was learned, what to do next
- Eliminates fragmentation of knowledge across dozens of files

📚 New/Updated Files:
- TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md (NEW) - Master synthesis document
- README.md (NEW) - Points all agents to master document
- OVERSEER_STRATEGIC_PLAN.md (UPDATED) - References master doc
- netlify.toml (UPDATED) - Clarifying comments added

🧠 Key Synthesized Content:
- Current deployment status (Oct 9, 2025)
- Complete system architecture (3 layers)
- Multi-agent Kaiako system (6 agents)
- 6-level nested content structure
- Security configuration & recent improvements
- Strategic plan with cultural validation first
- Critical issues & learnings (dialectical)
- Technology stack & file structure
- Quick starts for developers & teachers

🎓 Philosophical Shift:
From: Many fragmented documents
To: ONE living document + supporting specific-purpose docs

This enables:
- Any agent to get full context quickly
- Continuous updates in one place
- Collective memory across model switches
- Prevention of repeating past mistakes
- Dialectical learning embedded in documentation

🔄 Continuous Update Protocol:
- This document should be updated after every major change
- All agents responsible for keeping it current
- Recent Updates Log tracks evolution
- Version number increments with significant changes

📖 For Future Agents:
1. Read TE_KETE_AKO_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md first
2. Check current phase and status
3. Review recent updates log
4. Understand past learnings
5. Update document when done

🌟 This is the foundation for true multi-agent, multi-model collaboration.
