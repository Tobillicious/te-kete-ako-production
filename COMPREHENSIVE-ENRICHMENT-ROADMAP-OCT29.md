#### Unit 3 - Mātauranga Enrichment Example (Lesson 1)

**Current Lesson 1**: "Dual Knowledge Systems Foundation"  
**Add Specific Example**: **Matariki as Dual-Knowledge Case Study**

**Enrich With**:
```html
<section class="cultural-example">
  <h3>🌟 Case Study: Matariki - Where Knowledge Systems Meet</h3>
  
  <div class="dual-knowledge-comparison">
    <div class="traditional-knowledge">
      <h4>Mātauranga Māori Perspective</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Matariki</strong> (Pleiades star cluster) signals:
          - New Year (June/July rising)
          - Time to plant crops (kumara, taro)
          - Season for gathering kai moana
          - Honoring those who have passed
        </li>
        <li><strong>Traditional Practice</strong>: Tohunga would read the stars'
          brightness and position to predict the coming year's harvest</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Transmission</strong>: Passed down through whakapapa,
          learned by observation and practice with kaumātua</li>
        <li><strong>Holistic Integration</strong>: Astronomy + agriculture + 
          spirituality + community wellbeing all connected</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scientific-perspective">
      <h4>Western STEM Perspective</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Astronomical</strong>: Pleiades is an open star cluster
          ~444 light-years away, 7 main visible stars</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural Science</strong>: June rising correlates with:
          - Soil temperature optimal for planting (8-12°C)
          - Frost risk decreasing
          - Rainfall patterns shifting
        </li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Validation</strong>: Scientific method, peer review,
          published research</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized Domains</strong>: Astronomy separate from agriculture
          separate from cultural practice</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="synthesis">
    <h4>Where They Meet - Dual Knowledge Approach:</h4>
    <p>Both systems observe the same phenomenon (Matariki/Pleiades) and derive 
    practical agricultural guidance. Mātauranga Māori offers <strong>holistic integration</strong>
    (stars + planting + wellbeing + culture all connected). Western STEM offers 
    <strong>specialized depth</strong> (detailed astronomical measurements, soil science data).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Power of Integration</strong>: Use Matariki as cultural timing + 
    soil temperature sensors for precise planting decisions. Traditional knowledge 
    provides framework, modern tools add precision. <em>Both systems valid, 
    both valuable, stronger together.</em></p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="student-activity">
    <h4>Student Activity: Matariki Project</h4>
    <p>Research Matariki from both knowledge systems. Create presentation showing:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Traditional Māori knowledge about Matariki (interview kaumātua if possible)</li>
      <li>Scientific understanding of Pleiades cluster</li>
      <li>How both perspectives enhance each other</li>
      <li>Design a Matariki celebration that honors both knowledge systems</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Concrete**: Real cultural practice (Matariki), not abstract
- **Balanced**: Equal depth in both knowledge systems
- **Integrated**: Shows how they work together, not in opposition
- **Actionable**: Students can actually DO something with this
- **Culturally Safe**: Positions mātauranga as valid, not "alternative"

---
