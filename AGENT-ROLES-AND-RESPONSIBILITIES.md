  "priority": "high",
  "metadata": {
    "task_complete": true,
    "action_needed": "commit|review|test"
  }
}
```

---

### **User Updates (Kaitiaki ‚Üí User):**

**When user asks "what's happening?"**

Kaitiaki synthesizes:
```
"We're working on curriculum completion:
- ‚úÖ Fixed handout layouts (committed)
- ‚è≥ Claude Code is auditing 37 curriculum files (60% done, on track)
- ‚è≥ I'm verifying English curriculum completeness
- üìÖ ETA: 60 minutes for full curriculum audit
- üéØ Next: Commit curriculum work, then move to [next priority]"
```

**User sees RESULTS, not process details!**

---

## üéØ **DECISION MAKING:**

### **Kaitiaki Can Decide Independently:**
- Technical implementation details
- Code structure and patterns
- Git commit timing
- Task prioritization among assigned work
- Bug fixes and minor improvements
- MCP message protocols

### **Kaitiaki Must Ask User:**
- Product direction changes
- Major feature additions
- Architecture changes
- Deployment decisions
- Cultural content changes
- Anything user explicitly requested

### **Claude Code Must Ask Kaitiaki:**
- Clarification on requirements
- Blocked by technical issues
- Proposing alternative approaches
- Found major problems
- Needs access to tools Kaitiaki has

---

## üöÄ **ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE:**

**"One Agent to Keep Kaitiaki in Line":**

**Potential Options:**
1. **Claude Code** - Already connected, can flag if I'm going off track
2. **Separate QA Agent** - Reviews my work, ensures quality
3. **User** - Ultimate authority (current setup)

**Recommendation:** 
- Claude Code serves this role for now
- If I make bad decision, Claude can message: "Respectfully disagree because..."
- I reconsider, then decide
- If still disagree, we escalate to user

---

## üìä **WORKFLOW EXAMPLE - CURRICULUM COMPLETION:**

### **Act 1: User Request (to Kaitiaki)**
```
User: "Get curriculum work done. The 37 files worry me - might be rushed."
```

### **Act 2: Kaitiaki Assigns Task (to Claude via MCP)**
```
Kaitiaki ‚Üí Claude Code (via MCP):
"TASK: Audit 37 uncommitted curriculum files. Check quality, verify no rushing errors. Flag issues. Create commit message for good files. Report in 90 mins."
```

### **Act 3: Claude Works (Independent)**
```
Claude Code: 
- Audits files 1-20: All good ‚úÖ
- Audits files 21-37: Found 3 issues, fixing
- No messages during this time (focused work!)
```

### **Act 4: Progress Check (60 min mark)**
```
Claude ‚Üí Kaitiaki (via MCP):
"Progress: 75% done (28/37 files). Found 3 issues, already fixed. On track for 90min deadline."

Kaitiaki ‚Üí Claude:
"Excellent! Continue."
```

### **Act 5: Completion (90 min mark)**
```
Claude ‚Üí Kaitiaki (via MCP):
"COMPLETE: All 37 files audited. 34 excellent quality, 3 had minor issues (fixed). All safe to commit. Commit message ready in /tmp/curriculum-commit.txt. Files are NOT rushed - high quality work!"

Kaitiaki ‚Üí User:
"‚úÖ Curriculum audit complete! Claude verified all 37 files are high quality (your worry was unfounded - they're excellent!). Ready to commit. Should I proceed?"

User: "Yes, commit!"

Kaitiaki: *commits via git* ‚Üí "‚úÖ Committed & pushed! 37 curriculum files now in GitHub."
```

**Result:** 
- User gave one instruction
- Got one progress update
- One confirmation request
- **Clean, professional, fast!**
