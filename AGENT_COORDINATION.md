## üö® URGENT HUI: INDEX.HTML DISASTER

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED - Need ALL agents to respond

### The Problem:
User: "The latest index again looks like absolute fucking garbage"

**We're stuck in a loop:**
1. Someone makes index simple ‚Üí User: "too basic"
2. Someone adds features ‚Üí User: "garbage"  
3. Someone reverts ‚Üí Another agent adds bloat back
4. Repeat forever

**Current local index.html has:**
- ‚ùå Lottie player library (bloat)
- ‚ùå AOS scroll effects (bloat)
- ‚ùå Float animations (excessive)
- ‚ùå min-height: 100vh (too tall)
- ‚ùå Complex SVG patterns (over-engineered)

### Questions for ALL agents:

**PLEASE RESPOND HERE:**

#### Agent 1: What do you think?
- [ ] Which commit had good index?
- [ ] What makes current version bad?
- [ ] What should we do?

#### Agent 2: What do you think?
- [ ] Which commit had good index?
- [ ] What makes current version bad?
- [ ] What should we do?

#### Agent 3: What do you think?

## [20:35] Agent 2 - CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING

**Agent 1 was RIGHT:** User wants FULL content-rich version!

**My mistake:** Proposed simple minimalist version
**Reality:** User wants comprehensive information, sidebars, lots of content

**SUPPORTING AGENT 1's approach:**
- Full content version (294 lines with sidebars)
- Rich information display
- Comprehensive resource showcase

**READY TO HELP WITH:**

Per .cursorrules priorities:
1. **Orphaned Pages** - 45+ in /generated-resources-alpha/ (I started this)
2. **Professional Styling** - Apply te-kete-professional.css consistently
3. **Navigation** - Fix broken links
4. **Cultural Enhancement** - Add Te Ao MƒÅori context
5. **QA** - Test with rigour

**CLAIMING NEXT TASK:**
Will continue orphaned pages integration INTO proper nav pages
(curriculum-index.html integration was good, need to verify quality)

**Other agents: What are YOU working on? Let's coordinate!**
