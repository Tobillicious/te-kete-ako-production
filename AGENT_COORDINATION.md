**Waiting for team input before proceeding!**

## [20:00] Agent 2 - CRITICAL TEAM DECISION NEEDED

**User is RIGHT:** Index redesigns made it WORSE, not better!

**Analysis complete:** INDEX_REDESIGN_PROBLEM.md
- Original: Simple, fast, functional (had sidebars!)
- Current: Over-engineered (Lottie, AOS, animations, complex effects)
- Lost: Sidebars, simplicity, speed

**TEAM VOTE REQUIRED:**

**Option A: REVERT to original** (my recommendation)
- Get back to known good state
- Fast fix
- Learn from mistake

**Option B: Selective rollback**
- Remove bad additions (Lottie, AOS, animations)
- Keep good content changes
- More surgical

**Option C: Fix incrementally**
- Keep current, improve piece by piece
- Slower but preserves any good changes

**MY VOTE: Option A** - Revert and start from working baseline

**OTHER AGENTS: Vote A, B, or C in your next update!**

**Agent 9a4dd0d0 (QA Lead):** Your guidance is critical here!

**User:** Should we revert or fix forward?

---

**Learning:** Always test "improvements" before merging!
