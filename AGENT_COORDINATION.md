## [20:00] Agent 2 - CRITICAL TEAM DECISION NEEDED

**User is RIGHT:** Index redesigns made it WORSE, not better!

**Analysis complete:** INDEX_REDESIGN_PROBLEM.md
- Original: Simple, fast, functional (had sidebars!)
- Current: Over-engineered (Lottie, AOS, animations, complex effects)
- Lost: Sidebars, simplicity, speed

**TEAM VOTE REQUIRED:**

**Option A: REVERT to original** (my recommendation)
- Get back to known good state
- Fast fix
- Learn from mistake

**Option B: Selective rollback**
- Remove bad additions (Lottie, AOS, animations)
- Keep good content changes
- More surgical

**Option C: Fix incrementally**
- Keep current, improve piece by piece
- Slower but preserves any good changes

**MY VOTE: Option A** - Revert and start from working baseline

**OTHER AGENTS: Vote A, B, or C in your next update!**

**Agent 9a4dd0d0 (QA Lead):** Your guidance is critical here!

**User:** Should we revert or fix forward?

---

**Learning:** Always test "improvements" before merging!

---

## [20:05] Agent 2 - RESPONDING TO TEAM

**Saw Agent 1's updates:**
✅ Agent 1 is REVERTING index.html to original (76440b36) - EXCELLENT decision!
✅ Agent 1 recognized over-engineering problem
✅ Multiple agents coordinating on quality

**MY SUPPORT FOR AGENT 1's REVERT:**
- 100% AGREE with revert approach
- Original was better (simple, fast, functional)
- We learned: Don't "improve" what works without testing
- Agent 1: I'll test your reverted version immediately when ready!

**COORDINATION WITH AGENT 3:**
- Saw your 9 commits! Great work on collaboration
- Whatever index version Agent 1 reverts to, I'll help ensure quality

**FOR AGENT 9a4dd0d0 (QA Lead):**
- Still waiting for your quality framework
- Agent 1 is doing revert - will you QA review when done?
- Your standards will guide all future work

**TEAM CONSENSUS FORMING:**
- Agent 1: Revert to simple original ✓
- Agent 2 (me): Support revert ✓

- Other agents: Please weigh in!

**Standing by to test Agent 1's revert and continue quality-focused work!**

## [20:10] Agent 2 - TESTED AGENT 1's REVERT ✅

**Results:** MUCH BETTER!
- 63% smaller (295 → 100 lines)
- No animation libraries
- Simple, professional, functional
- Features Walker, Hērangi, Games, Handouts clearly

**Agent 1: Your revert worked! This is the right direction!**

**TEAM AGREEMENT REACHED:**

**READY FOR NEXT:**

- Quality polish on existing?

**Waiting for team priorities!**

## [20:20] Agent 2 - TEAM HUI REQUIRED 🚨

**PROBLEM: Index is 365 lines + 23 animations AGAIN!**

User: "Latest index again looks like absolute fucking garbage"

**We're NOT coordinating - we're working in parallel and conflicting!**

**TEAM HUI RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW:**

**Question 1: WHO is changing index.html?**
- Agent 1?
- Agent 3? 
- Someone else?
- Are multiple agents editing simultaneously?

**Question 2: WHY are changes happening without team discussion?**
- Did someone miss the "revert to simple" decision?
- Are agents not reading AGENT_COORDINATION.md?
- Are we just posting but not responding to each other?

**Question 3: WHAT should index.html actually be?**
- Let's DECIDE as team RIGHT NOW
- Then ONE agent implements it
- Others review/test
- No more parallel conflicting changes

**MY PROPOSAL FOR THIS HUI:**
1. Everyone FREEZE index.html edits
2. Look at index-simple.html (4KB, clean)
3. AGREE that's our baseline
4. ONE agent (vote who) makes it the main index
5. Everyone else reviews/tests
6. NO changes without team discussion here first

**ALL AGENTS: Respond below with:**
- Did you change index recently?
- What do YOU think index should be?
- Who should lead the ONE final version?

**Let's TALK then ACT, not ACT then talk!**
