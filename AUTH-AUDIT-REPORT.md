- ✅ INSERT: Both `anon` and `authenticated` can add schools (crowd-sourcing)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Remove duplicate INSERT policy on `profiles` table.

### 2. **LOGIN PAGE** ✅ MOSTLY PASS

**Visual Design:**

**Minor Issues:**
- ⚠️ Password field missing `autocomplete="current-password"` attribute

### 3. **CONSOLE ERRORS** ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES

**Issues Found:**
1. **Production console.logs still active:**
   - `🚀 Te Kete Ako main.js loaded successfully`
   - `🌟 Te Kete Ako initialized...`
   - `📱 PWA: Service Worker registered...`
   - `📊 Page view tracked:...`
   
   **Impact:** Low (informational only, but unprofessional in production)
   **Fix:** Comment out or remove before launch

2. **DOM Warning:**
   - `Input elements should have autocomplete attributes`
   - **Impact:** Very Low (UX suggestion, not breaking)
   - **Fix:** Add `autocomplete` attributes to password field
