## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS WORK

### **1. Navigation Mismatch - CRITICAL** 🔴

**Problem:** Navigation promises pages that don't have proper content

**Affected Pages:**
- `unit-plans.html` - Has header/nav but minimal content beyond that
- `lessons.html` - Has header/nav but minimal content beyond that  
- `handouts.html` - Likely similar issue
- `activities.html` - Referenced in nav, needs checking
- `games.html` - Has files, needs hub page with proper content
- `youtube.html` - Referenced in nav
- `curriculum-alignment.html` - Referenced multiple times
- `other-resources.html` - In footer

**What They Should Have:**
- Introduction/hero section explaining the resource type
- Grid/list of available resources
- Filtering if appropriate
- Proper metadata and descriptions

### **2. Browse Page Fallback Content** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- Uses `generateFallbackResources()` with 5 hardcoded examples
- Should connect to actual teaching content
- Filter dropdowns exist but no real dynamic filtering

**Needs:**
- Generate cards from actual handout/unit/lesson files
- Real metadata (subjects, year levels, descriptions)
- Working filters
- Or... simplify to static curated list with proper links

### **3. Content Organization Gap**

**Issue:** Rich content exists but isn't surfaced

**Inventory:**
- 60+ handouts ✅ exist
- 7 complete units ✅ exist  
- ~36 unit lessons ✅ exist
- 10 Y8 systems lessons ✅ exist
- 5+ games ✅ exist
- 2 standalone lessons ✅ exist

**But:** No proper index/browse pages to discover them

### **4. Missing/Stub Pages**

Pages referenced but need content:
- `curriculum-alignment.html` - Critical, referenced everywhere
- `curriculum-v2.html` - Interactive curriculum browser mentioned
- `login.html` / `register-simple.html` - Auth pages
- `my-kete.html` - Personal collections page
- `youtube.html` - Curated videos

## 🔍 GRAPHRAG & BACKEND STATE

**Supabase Backend:**
- `graphrag_resources` table (20,975 resources in database)
- `graphrag_relationships` table (1,190,295 relationships!)
- `resource_embeddings` table (pgvector, 123 embeddings so far)
- `agent_knowledge`, `agent_performance`, `agent_status` tables
- Custom views: `browse_resources_api`

**Local Knowledge:**
- `graphrag-knowledge-oct20-responsive-agent.json` - Platform audit
- Shows 13,772 resources, 238,600 relationships, 5,379 excellence resources
- 55.2% cultural integration

**Gap:** Rich GraphRAG data in Supabase, but clean build doesn't connect to it yet

## 🎯 TODAY'S WORK PRIORITIES

### **Phase 1: Deep Understanding (CURRENT)** ✅
- ✅ Start local server
- ✅ Browse and screenshot pages
- ✅ Read key files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ✅ Audit teaching content
- ✅ Document what exists
- ✅ Create this context map

### **Phase 2: Granular Navigation Polish**
Priority order:
1. Fix hover states/transitions on dropdown menus
2. Refine spacing and alignment
3. Test mobile responsiveness
4. Polish year level dropdown grid layout
5. Ensure consistent icon usage
6. Verify all links work

### **Phase 3: Teaching Content Pages**
Priority order:
1. `handouts.html` - Easiest (60+ files ready)
2. `unit-plans.html` - Clear structure (7 units + Y8 systems)
3. `lessons.html` - Medium complexity (~46 lesson files)
4. `games.html` - Simple hub page (5 games)
5. `activities.html` - Check what's needed

**Approach for each:**
- Use Y8 Systems Unit hub as template (it's excellent)
- Create clean card grids
- Add proper descriptions
- Include subject/year level badges
- Link to actual files
- Add cultural integration indicators

### **Phase 4: Missing Critical Pages**
1. `curriculum-alignment.html` - High impact, referenced everywhere
2. `youtube.html` - Simple curated list
3. `other-resources.html` - External links collection

---

## 🚫 WHAT TO IGNORE

**Do NOT touch:**
- `/dist/` folder - Old complex build, archived
- `/backups/` folder - Historical
- `.log` files - Historical indexing records
- Planning docs (MASTER-PLAN.md, etc.) - Context only

---

## ✨ DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO MAINTAIN

**From existing polish:**
1. **Bilingual First:** Every label has Māori + English
2. **Cultural Grounding:** Not decorative, meaningful integration
3. **Print-First:** Every teaching resource must print beautifully on A4
4. **Emoji Icons:** Consistent, meaningful use throughout
5. **Whitespace:** Generous spacing, clean layouts
6. **Academic Rigor:** Cite research, link to Ministry resources
7. **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
8. **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JS, better with it

**Color Meanings:**
- English: `#5B8DBE` (Blue - communication)
- Math: `#8B2E4E` (Burgundy - logic)
- Science: `#1E5741` (Forest green - nature)
- Social Studies: `#6B4C9A` (Purple - society)
- Te Reo: `#40B5AD` (Teal - cultural treasure)
- Arts: `#C17A4F` (Earth tones - creativity)
- Health/PE: `#D64045` (Red - vitality)
- Technology: `#8B6F47` (Brown - innovation)
