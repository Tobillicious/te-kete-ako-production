# ðŸ‘¤ USER #1 INTERVIEW - The Real Teacher

**You are the teacher we need to serve. Let's figure out what you actually need.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ PART 1: YOUR CURRENT REALITY

### **What do you teach?**
- Subject(s):
- Year level(s):
- School type:
- How many students:
- How many lessons per week:

### **What's your biggest pain point RIGHT NOW with lesson resources?**
(Not theoretical - what frustrated you THIS WEEK?)

### **How do you currently find/create lessons?**
- Google search?
- TES/Twinkl?
- Make from scratch?
- Steal from colleagues? (honest answer!)
- How long does this take?

### **When you look at our current 1,525 resources, what do you see?**
- Are they useful to you?
- Can you find what you need?
- What's broken?
- What's missing?

### **Do you actually care about "cultural integration" or is that our assumption?**
- How important is it? (1-10)
- Do you have time to think about it?
- Or do you just need a lesson that WORKS for tomorrow?

## ðŸŽ¯ PART 2: THE HONEST QUESTIONS

### **If you could wave a magic wand, what would this site do for you?**

### **What would make you use this EVERY WEEK instead of Google?**

### **Would you pay $12/month for this? Why/why not?**

### **Do you want AI to generate lessons or do you want human-made, validated resources?**
(Honest answer - not what sounds good)

### **When you're planning tomorrow's lesson at 8pm tonight, what do you need?**
- Fast?
- Perfect?
- Good enough?
- Ready to print?

### **What features in my "vision docs" sound like bullshit to you?**
(3D knowledge graphs? Gamification? AI orchestrator? Be brutal)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ PART 3: THE CURRENT SITE

### **Load the site right now. Try to find a resource you'd actually use.**

**What happened?**
- How long did it take?
- Did you find something useful?
- What was frustrating?
- What would have made it faster?

### **Look at the homepage. First impression?**

### **Try the search. Does it work?**

### **Look at a lesson page. Would you use it tomorrow?**
- Why / why not?

---

## ðŸŽ¯ PART 4: THE BRUTAL TRUTH

### **If I built everything in "THE-HONEST-PLAN.md", would you use it?**

### **If I built everything in "COMPLETE-VISION-SYNTHESIS.md", would you use it?**

### **Or would you just keep using Google/TES because it's faster?**

### **What's the ONE thing that would make you come back here every week?**
(Not three things. ONE thing.)

## ðŸŽ¯ PART 5: THE DECISION

Based on YOUR answers (not my assumptions), we'll know:

1. **Is there a real problem worth solving?**
2. **What's the simplest solution that would actually help YOU?**
3. **Should we build the fancy AI stuff or just fix search?**
4. **Is this even worth building or should we pivot?**

**Ready to answer these honestly?**

(This is way more valuable than 10 hypothetical teacher interviews)
