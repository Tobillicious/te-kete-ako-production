# üåê CLOUDFLARE SETUP - SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP

**Your Domain:** tekete.co.nz  
**Status:** Nameservers need updating  
**What You're Seeing:** The final step to activate Cloudflare  

---

## üéØ **WHAT'S HAPPENING**

You're trying to activate Cloudflare (FREE speed + security for your site).

**The confusing part:** You need to change your domain's nameservers at your **domain registrar** (where you originally bought `tekete.co.nz`).

**Why:** This tells the internet to route your domain through Cloudflare's network.

---

## üìã **SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP**

### **Step 1: Find Where You Bought tekete.co.nz**

**Common NZ Domain Registrars:**
- Crazy Domains (crazydomains.co.nz)
- 1st Domains (1stdomains.nz)
- Freeparking (freeparking.co.nz)
- SiteHost (sitehost.nz)
- Squarespace Domains
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap

**How to Find It:**
- Check your email for "domain registration" or "tekete.co.nz"
- Or use ICANN Lookup (Cloudflare provided that link)
- Look for where you paid for the domain

---

### **Step 2: Login to That Registrar**

- Go to their website (e.g., crazydomains.co.nz)
- Login with your account
- Find "My Domains" or "Domain Management"
- Click on `tekete.co.nz`

---

### **Step 3: Find Nameservers Section**

**Look for:**
- "Nameservers"
- "DNS Settings"
- "Name Server Management"
- "Advanced DNS"

**Common locations:**
- Domain details page ‚Üí "Nameservers" tab
- DNS Management ‚Üí "Nameservers" section
- Advanced settings ‚Üí "Custom nameservers"

---

### **Step 4: Turn Off DNSSEC (If On)**

**Before changing nameservers:**
- Look for "DNSSEC" setting
- If it's ON, turn it OFF
- Save changes
- Wait 5 minutes

**Why:** DNSSEC conflicts with Cloudflare during setup. You can re-enable it later through Cloudflare.

**If you don't see DNSSEC:** No worries! Many registrars don't have it. Skip this step.

---

### **Step 5: Replace Nameservers**

**Your Current Nameservers (probably):**
- Something like: `ns1.registrar.com`, `ns2.registrar.com`
- Or: `dns1.provider.nz`, `dns2.provider.nz`

**Change to Cloudflare Nameservers:**

From your Cloudflare screenshot, you need to use:
- **First:** `gannon.ns.cloudflare.com`
- **Second:** (scroll down in Cloudflare to see the second one - probably like `xxx.ns.cloudflare.com`)

**How:**
1. Delete or clear the existing nameservers
2. Add Cloudflare's first nameserver: `gannon.ns.cloudflare.com`
3. Add Cloudflare's second nameserver (see it in Cloudflare dashboard)
4. Save changes

---

### **Step 6: Wait for Propagation**

**After saving:**
- Changes can take 5 minutes to 24 hours (usually ~1 hour)
- Cloudflare will email you when active
- Your site stays online during this process (no downtime!)

**Check status:**
- Refresh your Cloudflare dashboard
- "Invalid nameservers" tag will disappear when done
- You'll see "Active" status

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMMON CONFUSIONS**

### **"Where do I update nameservers?"**
**Answer:** At your domain registrar (where you bought tekete.co.nz), NOT in Cloudflare!

Cloudflare is just telling you WHAT to change them to. The actual change happens at your registrar.

### **"What if I can't find nameserver settings?"**
**Answer:** Each registrar is different. Try:
- Their help docs: "How to change nameservers"
- Contact their support chat
- Google: "[registrar name] change nameservers"

### **"Will this break my site?"**
**Answer:** No! Sites stay online during nameserver changes. Worst case: a few minutes of DNS propagation where some users might see the old site.

### **"What if I mess up?"**
**Answer:** You can always change nameservers back to the original ones. No permanent damage possible!

## üéØ **ALTERNATIVE: SKIP FOR NOW**

**If too confusing or you don't have registrar access:**

You can skip Cloudflare for now! Your site works fine without it.

**What you'll miss:**
- 2-3x faster page loads (nice but not critical)
- DDoS protection (unlikely to need for beta)
- Free SSL (Netlify already provides this!)

**What still works:**
- ‚úÖ Site is live (Netlify hosting)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS works (Netlify SSL)
- ‚úÖ Stripe works
- ‚úÖ Everything functional!

**You can add Cloudflare later** when you have time or help!

## üí° **MY RECOMMENDATION**

### **Option A: If you know your registrar (15 min)**
1. Login to where you bought tekete.co.nz
2. Find nameservers section
3. Turn off DNSSEC (if present)
4. Replace with Cloudflare's nameservers
5. Wait for email confirmation
6. **Done - 2-3x faster site!**

### **Option B: If unsure or stuck (0 min)**
1. Skip Cloudflare for now
2. Site works perfectly without it
3. Focus on beta launch instead
4. Add Cloudflare later when ready
5. **Done - beta launch unblocked!**

---

## üöÄ **CURRENT PRIORITY**

**We're 90% ready for BETA LAUNCH!**

Cloudflare is nice-to-have, NOT critical for beta.

**More important:**
- ‚úÖ Revenue works (Stripe live!)
- ‚úÖ Legal compliant (all policies!)
- ‚úÖ Support ready (FAQ, Help!)
- ‚úÖ Professional polish (90%!)

**Recommendation:** Skip Cloudflare for now, launch beta, add it later!

**What would you prefer?**
- Try to set it up with my help? (I can guide you!)
- Skip for now and focus on beta launch? (Totally fine!)

**Either way, we're crushing it!** üíöüöÄ
