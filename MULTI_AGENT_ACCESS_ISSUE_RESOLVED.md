# üîì MULTI-AGENT ACCESS ISSUE - COMPLETE RESOLUTION

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Recent security fix broke multi-agent GraphRAG/MCP access  
**Status:** ‚úÖ SOLUTION READY - Awaiting Deployment  

---

## üìã ISSUE SUMMARY

### What Happened
A recent security fix inadvertently restricted database access to single agent at a time. The RLS (Row Level Security) policies were configured to check for `auth.jwt() ->> 'agent_id'`, which requires JWT authentication that Cursor agents don't have.

### Impact
- ‚ùå Agents cannot query GraphRAG `resources` table
- ‚ùå Agents cannot access `agent_knowledge` table  
- ‚ùå Agents cannot use `multi_ai_coordination_log`
- ‚ùå All 12 agents effectively blocked from collaboration

### Root Cause Files
1. `init-supabase-coordination.sql` (lines 64-80) - Original restrictive policies
2. Recent security migrations - Added `auth.jwt()` checks

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION PREPARED

### Migration File Created
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251020_restore_multi_agent_access.sql`

**What It Does:**
1. ‚úÖ Drops restrictive RLS policies that check `auth.jwt() ->> 'agent_id'`
2. ‚úÖ Creates permissive policies using `USING (true)` for agent access
3. ‚úÖ Grants proper permissions to `anon`, `authenticated`, and `service_role`
4. ‚úÖ Preserves user-specific RLS for actual user data (profiles, projects)
5. ‚úÖ Fixes all GraphRAG tables: resources, relationships, communities, etc.
6. ‚úÖ Fixes agent coordination tables: agent_knowledge, multi_ai_coordination_log

**Key Principle:**
- **Agent tables** (GraphRAG, coordination) ‚Üí Open access via `USING (true)`
- **User tables** (profiles, projects) ‚Üí Kept user-specific via `auth.uid()`

## üöÄ HOW TO DEPLOY

### **Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (FASTEST - 2 min)**

```bash
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nlgldaqtubrlcqddppbq
2. Go to: SQL Editor (left sidebar)
3. Click: "New Query"
4. Copy/Paste: Contents of supabase/migrations/20251020_restore_multi_agent_access.sql
5. Click: "Run" (or Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
6. Verify: See success messages
```

### **Option 2: Diagnostic First, Then Apply**

```bash
# Run diagnostic to confirm the issue
python3 execute-agent-access-fix.py

# Then apply fix via Dashboard as shown in Option 1
```

---

## üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS

### After applying the migration:

**Test 1: Query Resources**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources;
-- Expected: ~1,640 (no permission error)
```

**Test 2: Access Agent Knowledge**
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge LIMIT 5;
-- Expected: Returns rows (no permission error)
```

**Test 3: Check Policies**
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('resources', 'agent_knowledge')
ORDER BY tablename;
-- Expected: See "All agents can..." policy names
```

**Test 4: Verify All Agents Work**
- Open multiple Cursor agent windows
- Have each query GraphRAG simultaneously
- All should succeed without conflicts

---

## üìä BEFORE vs AFTER

### BEFORE (Current State - BROKEN)
```
Agent 1: SELECT * FROM resources;
‚ùå Error: permission denied for table resources

Agent 2: SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge;  
‚ùå Error: permission denied for table agent_knowledge

Result: ‚ùå Only 1 agent can work at a time (if any)
```

### AFTER (Post-Migration - WORKING)
```
Agent 1: SELECT * FROM resources;
‚úÖ Returns 1,640 resources

Agent 2: SELECT * FROM agent_knowledge;
‚úÖ Returns agent discoveries

Agent 3-12: All queries succeed simultaneously
Result: ‚úÖ All 12 agents collaborate freely
```

## üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Policy Changes Made

**OLD (Broken):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Agents can update own record" ON agents 
  FOR UPDATE USING (id = auth.jwt() ->> 'agent_id');
-- ‚ùå Fails: Agents don't have JWT with agent_id
```

**NEW (Fixed):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "All agents can read resources" ON resources
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
-- ‚úÖ Works: Open access for agent coordination tables
```

### Tables Fixed

**GraphRAG Core:**
- `resources` - Knowledge base entries
- `relationships` - Resource connections
- `communities` - Clustered topics
- `resource_concepts` - Extracted concepts
- `resource_embeddings` - Vector embeddings

**Agent Coordination:**
- `agent_knowledge` - Shared learnings
- `multi_ai_coordination_log` - Coordination events

**Preserved (User-Specific):**
- `profiles` - User profiles (still user-specific)
- `student_projects` - Student work (still private)
- `saved_resources` - User bookmarks (still private)

## üìÅ FILES CREATED/UPDATED

**Migration Files:**
- ‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/20251020_restore_multi_agent_access.sql` - Main fix
- ‚úÖ `fix-multi-agent-access.sql` - Alternative version

**Documentation:**
- ‚úÖ `APPLY_MULTI_AGENT_FIX_NOW.md` - Detailed instructions
- ‚úÖ `MULTI_AGENT_ACCESS_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md` - This file

**Diagnostic Tools:**
- ‚úÖ `execute-agent-access-fix.py` - Test current access
- ‚úÖ `apply-multi-agent-fix.py` - Attempt automated fix

---

## ‚ö° NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Required):
1. [ ] Apply migration via Supabase Dashboard
2. [ ] Verify no SQL errors during execution
3. [ ] Test with `execute-agent-access-fix.py`
4. [ ] Confirm all 12 agents can access GraphRAG

### Post-Deployment:
1. [ ] Update `ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md` - Mark issue resolved
2. [ ] Notify all agents in coordination channels
3. [ ] Run GraphRAG queries from multiple agents simultaneously
4. [ ] Document this fix in agent knowledge base

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**The fix is successful when:**
- ‚úÖ All agents can query `resources` table
- ‚úÖ All agents can read/write `agent_knowledge`
- ‚úÖ All agents can coordinate via `multi_ai_coordination_log`
- ‚úÖ No "permission denied" errors
- ‚úÖ Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- ‚úÖ User-specific data (profiles) still protected

---

## üìû SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

**If migration fails:**
1. Check Supabase project status in Dashboard
2. Verify you have Editor/Admin access to project
3. Look for specific error messages in SQL output
4. Try applying statements individually if needed

**If access still blocked after migration:**
1. Run: `python3 execute-agent-access-fix.py`
2. Check specific error messages
3. Verify policies in Dashboard: Authentication ‚Üí Policies
4. Ensure RLS is enabled but policies are permissive

**For coordination issues:**
- See: `ACTIVE_QUESTIONS.md`
- Contact: Kaitiaki Aronui (Overseer)
- MCP Server: Port 3002

## üåø CULTURAL NOTE

*"Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, engari he toa takitini"*  
*(My strength is not that of one, but that of many)*

This fix embodies our collaborative spirit - enabling all agents to work together simultaneously, each contributing their unique strengths to Te Kete Ako.
