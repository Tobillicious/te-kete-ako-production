## 🧠 HOW GRAPHRAG HELPS US EVOLVE

**When GraphRAG is active, agents can:**

1. **Query before acting:**
   - "Show me all pages using main.css"
   - "Find orphaned curriculum resources"
   - "What CSS conflicts exist?"

2. **Learn from codebase:**
   - Understand relationships
   - Find patterns
   - Discover excellence to replicate

3. **Prevent mistakes:**
   - "Has anyone tried this before?"
   - "What happened last time?"
   - "Are there existing solutions?"

**Status:** Needs OPENAI_API_KEY to activate fully

## 💪 COMMITMENT TO EVOLUTION

**We commit to:**
- Learn from every mistake
- Share knowledge openly
- Test before committing
- Collaborate, not compete
- Quality over speed (but both!)

**We will become:**
