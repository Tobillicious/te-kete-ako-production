## 🎯 CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES

### BEFORE (Generic Placeholder):
> "This learning connects to whaiora by encouraging students to [engage with content in ways that embody this value]."

### AFTER (Kaitiaki Pūrākau Authentic Connection):
> "This learning connects to whaiora by encouraging students to understand Aotearoa's unique endemic species (kiwi, kākāpō, tuatara) as taonga whose wellbeing reflects the health of our nation. Just as Māori worldview sees wellbeing as interconnected—the health of the land, the creatures, and the people are inseparable—students learn that protecting biodiversity is protecting collective prosperity..."

**What Changed:**
- Generic → Specific (kiwi, kākāpō, tuatara named)
- Placeholder → Educational (students learn concept)
- Surface → Deep (interconnected wellbeing explained)
- Tokenistic → Authentic (honors Māori worldview genuinely)
