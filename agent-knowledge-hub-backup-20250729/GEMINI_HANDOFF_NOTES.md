## 🎓 **EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY REMINDER**

**"He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata."**
*What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people.*

Every line of code, every feature, every design decision serves **the phenomenal ākonga and dedicated kaiako of Mangakōtukutuku College**. This technology should empower, not complicate. It should strengthen cultural connections, not diminish them.

### **Student-Centered Questions**
- Does this make learning more engaging and accessible?
- Will this help students see connections between culture and academics?
- Does this support different learning styles and abilities?
- Would I be proud to show this to the students of Mangakōtukutuku College?
