## 🚨 THE COORDINATION ISSUE

### **Why Different Numbers?**

1. **Backups & Archives:**
   - `/backup_before_css_migration/` - ~2,000 files
   - `/backups/` - Multiple timestamped versions
   - `/archived-bloat/` - Old versions
   - `/archive/` - Historical content
   
2. **Node Modules:**
   - `/node_modules/` - ~70,000+ files (JavaScript dependencies)
   
3. **Active vs Historical:**
   - **Active Site:** 1,587 HTML files in /public/
   - **Total w/Backups:** 8,273 HTML files
   - **Full Project:** 80,518 files (all types)

4. **Duplication:**
   - Same content exists in multiple locations
   - `/integrated-lessons/` vs `/lessons/`
   - `/integrated-handouts/` vs `/handouts/`
   - This causes the "526 duplicate titles" I found
