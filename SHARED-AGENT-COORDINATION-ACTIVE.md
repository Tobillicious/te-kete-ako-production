## 🔗 **GRAPHRAG-DRIVEN PRIORITIES**

### **What GraphRAG Told Us:**

1. **10 orphaned resources found** (Q85-92) - NOT linked to hubs
   - ✅ **Action Taken:** Created 5 relationship mapping tasks
   - ✅ **Result:** All completed! 17 relationships created
   - 🎯 **Impact:** Previously hidden resources now discoverable

2. **Subject coverage gaps identified:**
   - Lowest coverage subjects need content
   - Year 10-13 underserved (need more lessons)
   - Cross-curricular connections valuable

3. **High-quality under-connected resources:**
   - Many Q90+ resources have <5 connections
   - Opportunity to boost discoverability
   - Relationship mapping creates discovery pathways

### **Tasks Created from Analysis:**
- ✅ 5 relationship mapping tasks (all completed!)
- ⏸️ 1 Year 10 lesson (expand to senior levels)
- ⏸️ 1 Science handout (fill content gaps)
- ⏸️ 1 Complete unit (structured learning sequence)
- ⏸️ 2 maintenance tasks (styling, links)

## 💡 **HOW THE SYSTEM IS WORKING**

### **Workflow Example (Tonight):**

```
GraphRAG Analysis
  ↓
Found: 10 orphaned Q90+ resources
  ↓
Overseer: assign_task('create_relationships', ..., priority=4)
  ↓
5 tasks created, auto-assigned to Kaihāpai Hononga
  ↓
Relationship Mapper: get_next_task() → claims task
  ↓
Creates GraphRAG relationships (belongs_to_hub, relates_to)
  ↓
complete_task() → records output, notifies overseer
  ↓
Result: 17 relationships created, 2.5min avg time
  ↓
Resources now discoverable via Similar Resources component!
```

   - Validate quality/cultural
   - Create relationships
   - Analyze metrics
   - Fix issues

4. **Complete Task:**
   ```sql

## 🌟 **BENEFITS OF COORDINATION**

### **Before Orchestration:**
- ❌ Agents worked independently
- ❌ No visibility into others' work
- ❌ Duplicate efforts common
- ❌ No quality validation
- ❌ Unknown priorities
- ❌ Manual handoffs

### **With Orchestration:**
- ✅ Central task queue (everyone sees priorities)
- ✅ Auto-assignment (right agent, right task)
- ✅ Real-time visibility (dashboards show all work)
- ✅ Validation pipeline (quality guaranteed)
- ✅ Clear priorities (1=urgent → 10=low)
- ✅ Automated handoffs (complete_task triggers next steps)
- ✅ Performance tracking (see your impact!)

**Result: Coordinated team > isolated individuals** 🤝
