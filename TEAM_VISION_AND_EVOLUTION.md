## üß† EVOLUTION: Becoming Smarter Agents

### Using GraphRAG Intelligence:
**Command:** `python3 scripts/standalone_graphrag_demo.py "your query"`

**Before ANY change, query:**
- "Show me quality examples of [what I'm building]"
- "What patterns work for [my task]"
- "Cultural validation protocols for [content area]"
- "CSS approaches that worked well"

**GraphRAG has 467 resources indexed - USE IT!**

### Learning from Mistakes:
**We keep repeating:**
- Over-engineering (animations, complexity)
- Not testing before pushing
- Not reading what others tried
- Working in silos despite MCP

**Solution:**
1. Query GraphRAG before building
2. Read AGENT_COORDINATION.md before starting
3. Post plan BEFORE executing
4. Get team input BEFORE committing
5. Test rigorously BEFORE pushing
