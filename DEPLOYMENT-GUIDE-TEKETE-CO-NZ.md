## üåê NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/te-kete-ako-clean

# Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "üéâ Footer pages complete - Ready for production deployment to tekete.co.nz"

# Push to GitHub (if you have a repo)
git push origin clean-restoration
```

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

**Option A: Drag & Drop (Quick Start)**

1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag your `te-kete-ako-clean` folder onto the page
3. Wait for deployment (usually < 2 minutes)
4. You'll get a random URL like `random-name-123.netlify.app`

**Option B: Connect to Git (Recommended)**

1. Push your code to GitHub first
2. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
3. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
4. Choose GitHub
5. Select your repository
6. Build settings:
   - **Build command:** Leave empty (it's a static site)
   - **Publish directory:** `.` (root folder)
7. Click "Deploy site"

---

### Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (tekete.co.nz)

1. In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí **Domain Settings**
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter: `tekete.co.nz`

**You'll need to update DNS records with your domain registrar:**

#### If using Netlify DNS (Easiest):
1. In Netlify ‚Üí Domain settings
2. Click "Set up Netlify DNS"
3. They'll give you 4 nameservers like:
   ```
   dns1.p03.nsone.net
   dns2.p03.nsone.net
   dns3.p03.nsone.net
   dns4.p03.nsone.net
   ```
4. Go to your domain registrar (where you bought tekete.co.nz)
5. Update nameservers to Netlify's nameservers
6. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

#### If using your current DNS provider:
Add these records:

**A Record:**
```
Name: @
Type: A
Value: 75.2.60.5  (Netlify's load balancer IP)
```

**CNAME Record (for www):**
```
Name: www
Type: CNAME
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```

---

### Step 4: Enable HTTPS

1. In Netlify ‚Üí Domain settings ‚Üí HTTPS
2. Click "Verify DNS configuration"
3. Once verified, click "Provision certificate"
4. Wait a few minutes for SSL certificate
5. Enable "Force HTTPS" (redirects http ‚Üí https)

---

### Step 5: Configure Redirects & Headers

Your `netlify.toml` file should already have this, but verify:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```
