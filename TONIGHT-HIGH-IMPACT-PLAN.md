## 🎯 TONIGHT'S FOCUS: POLISH THE SHOWCASE UNITS

### **Strategy:**
Instead of fixing broken Tailwind lessons (Units 2 & 4), let's make the CLEAN units ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

**Target Units for Showcase:**
1. **Unit 3: STEM + Mātauranga** (your favorite!)
2. **Unit 1: Te Ao Māori** (foundation unit)
3. **Unit 7: Digital Tech & AI Ethics** (cutting-edge, has our new lessons)

**Why these 3?**
- All lessons are clean (no Tailwind)
- Diverse subject areas (Science, Social Studies, Te Reo, Digital Tech)
- Show breadth of curriculum
- High-interest topics for principals

## 📋 PROFESSIONALIZATION CHECKLIST

### **What We'll Add to EACH Lesson:**

#### 1. **Formative Assessment Checkpoints** ✅
Add 2-3 "check for understanding" moments throughout each lesson:

```html
<div class="formative-check">
    <h4>🔍 Formative Check (5 minutes)</h4>
    <p><strong>Quick Check:</strong> Students write one sentence explaining [key concept] to their partner.</p>
    <p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> Can identify and explain the main idea in their own words.</p>
</div>
```

#### 2. **Teacher Notes & Tips** ✅
Practical guidance for implementing the lesson:

```html
<div class="teacher-tip">
    <h4>💡 Teacher Tip</h4>
    <p><strong>Common Misconception:</strong> Students often think [X]. Clarify by [Y].</p>
    <p><strong>Time Management:</strong> If running short, [prioritize this].</p>
    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> [List]</p>
</div>
```

#### 3. **Whānau Connection** ✅
Already have this in new lessons - add to older ones:

```html
<section class="lesson-section">
    <h2>💬 Whānau Connection</h2>
    <p>Students share [topic] with whānau and discuss: [thoughtful question]</p>
</section>
```

#### 4. **Accessibility Scaffolds** ✅
Differentiation for diverse learners:

```html
<div class="accessibility-note">
    <h4>♿ Accessibility & Differentiation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>EAL Support:</strong> [Visual aids, sentence frames, partner work]</li>
        <li><strong>Dyslexia:</strong> [Audio options, graphic organizers, extra time]</li>
        <li><strong>Extension:</strong> [Advanced research, leadership roles, complex analysis]</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

#### 5. **Cultural Grounding** ✅
Ensure every lesson has:
- Opening karakia reference
- Whakataukī connection to lesson content
- Te reo Māori vocabulary integrated naturally
- Cultural context for non-Māori students

## 🎨 CSS NEEDED FOR NEW LESSON ELEMENTS

I'll add styles for:

These will be subtle, print-friendly, and match site aesthetic.
