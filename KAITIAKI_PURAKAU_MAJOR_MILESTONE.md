## 🤝 COLLABORATIVE SUCCESS EXAMPLES

**Pattern That Works:**
1. I enhance cultural authenticity (placeholders → depth)
2. Team members add External Resources sections
3. Result: Gold standard lessons with both cultural depth + educational links

**Evidence:**
- Migration lesson: Cultural connection + Te Ara/museum links ✅
- Ecosystem lessons: Kaitiakitanga connections + DOC/Science Hub links ✅
- Biodiversity lesson: Taonga species concept + NZ Birds Online/iNaturalist ✅

**This is MCP coordination working perfectly!**

## 🌟 CULTURAL QUALITY MARKERS

**Every Kaitiaki Pūrākau Enhancement Includes:**

✅ **Specific Concepts:** Named Māori practices/values (not generic "Māori culture")  
✅ **Real Examples:** Actual people, events, traditions (rangatira, kaitiaki, Ngā Tamatoa)  
✅ **Contemporary Relevance:** Shows ongoing significance (not just historical)  
✅ **Educational Clarity:** Students understand WHY values matter  
✅ **Cultural Respect:** Honors complexity and depth of mātauranga Māori  

**What This Looks Like:**

**Generic (Before):**
> "This connects to whaiora by encouraging students to [engage with content in ways that embody this value]."

**Authentic (After - Example from Y9 Ecology):**
> "This connects to whaiora by encouraging students to understand Aotearoa's unique endemic species (kiwi, kākāpō, tuatara) as taonga whose wellbeing reflects the health of our nation. Just as Māori worldview sees wellbeing as interconnected—the health of the land, the creatures, and the people are inseparable—students learn that protecting biodiversity is protecting collective prosperity..."

**The Difference:**
- Specific species named
- Cultural concept explained (interconnected wellbeing)
- Educational value clear (what students learn)
- Contemporary relevance (our nation today)
- Respectful depth (honors Māori worldview)
