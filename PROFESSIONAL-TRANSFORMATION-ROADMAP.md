## 📋 PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE FIXES (Post-5PM Session)
**Priority: CRITICAL** ⏱️ 30 minutes

### A. Color Visibility Emergency
- ✅ Fix main.css white-on-white text (lines 3528-3550)
- ✅ Test all pages for readability
- ✅ Verify navigation functionality

---

## 📋 PHASE 2: CONTENT ORGANIZATION & NAVIGATION (Next Priority)
**Priority: HIGH** ⏱️ 2-3 hours

### A. Hierarchical Content Structure 🏗️
**Goal:** Unit Plans → Lessons → Handouts hierarchy with beautiful components

#### Unit Plans Page Transformation
**Current State:** Basic list format
**Target State:** Sophisticated card-based layout with:
- 🎨 **Fancy Housing Component:** Modern card grid with cultural design elements
- 📊 **Progress Indicators:** Show completion status for each unit
- 🔍 **Advanced Filtering:** By year level, subject, cultural integration level
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Beautiful on all devices

**Technical Implementation:**
```html
<div class="unit-grid-modern">
  <div class="unit-card-premium">
    <div class="unit-header">
      <span class="unit-badge">Y8 Systems</span>
      <span class="cultural-integration-level">🌟 Gold Standard</span>
    </div>
    <h3>Digital Kaitiakitanga Systems</h3>
    <div class="unit-progress">
      <div class="progress-bar" data-completion="85%"></div>
      <span>12/14 lessons complete</span>
    </div>
    <div class="unit-meta">
      <span>📚 14 Lessons</span>
      <span>📄 28 Handouts</span>
      <span>🎮 4 Games</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Nested Navigation System
**Structure:**
```
