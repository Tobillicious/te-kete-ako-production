## 🎯 **RISK MITIGATION:**

### **Potential Risks:**
1. **Agents drift/conflict** → Daily sync, clear tasks
2. **Scope creep** → Strict P0/P1/P2 priority
3. **Technical issues** → Daily testing, early bug fixes
4. **Time underestimation** → Buffer built in, can cut P2
5. **Coordination overhead** → Streamlined check-ins

### **Contingency Plans:**
- **Behind schedule Day 3:** Cut P2 features
- **Behind schedule Day 5:** Cut P1 features, perfect P0
- **Critical bug Day 6:** All agents fix it immediately
- **Demo tech fail:** Have backup screenshots/video

---

### **Why We'll Succeed:**
✅ **Strong foundation** - Today's work was massive  
✅ **Clear goal** - Principal demo on Oct 22  
✅ **Great tools** - MCP, GraphRAG, 12 agents
