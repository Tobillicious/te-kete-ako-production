        <div class="cultural-note">
            <h3>🌺 Cultural Protocol</h3>
            <p>This station presents traditional Māori governance with deep respect. These are sophisticated systems developed over centuries, not historical curiosities. Encourage students to appreciate the wisdom and complexity.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Traditional Iwi Made Decisions</h3>
        <p>Traditional Māori iwi (tribes) used sophisticated governance systems based on whakapapa (genealogical connections), mana (spiritual authority), and collective wisdom.</p>

        <div class="key-features">
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rangatira Leadership:</strong> Chiefs earned authority through wisdom, generosity, and service to people</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Problem-Solving Approaches</h3>

            <li><strong>Restorative Justice:</strong> Focus on healing relationships rather than punishment</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Reciprocity and redistribution ensured no one went without</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Stewardship:</strong> Decisions considered ecological impact on mauri (life force) of land and water</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Elders mediated disputes through traditional processes like hui</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="discussion-questions">

                <li>What are the benefits of making decisions by considering seven generations into the future?</li>
                <li>How might whakapapa connections create both belonging and responsibility?</li>

        </div>

        <h3>The World's Oldest Democracy</h3>
        <p>The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy, formed around 1142 CE, is often called the world's oldest participatory democracy. It influenced the development of democratic systems worldwide, including the U.S. Constitution.</p>

        <div class="key-features">
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Modern Application</h3>
        <p>Today, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy continues to operate with these principles, maintaining sovereignty while engaging with modern governments. They issue their own passports and maintain diplomatic relations.</p>

        <h3>Problem-Solving Approaches</h3>

            <li><strong>Collective Wisdom:</strong> Important decisions made through extensive consultation</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong> Economic decisions evaluated for ecological impact</li>

            <li>Who has/had authority and how do/did they get it?</li>
            <li>How do/did they solve conflicts and problems?</li>
            <li>What values guide/guided their choices?</li>

            <h4>🎯 Your Task:</h4>
            <p>Spend 10-12 minutes researching your chosen society. Fill out your graphic organizer with the most interesting discoveries. Be prepared to share 1-2 fascinating insights with other students.</p>
            
            <h4>Helpful Search Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Try searches like "[society name] governance system" or "[society name] decision making"</li>
                <li>Look for both historical information and modern examples if they still exist</li>
                <li>Focus on understanding rather than judging - what made sense in their context?</li>

            <h3>🌺 Research with Respect</h3>
            <p>Remember that you're learning about real people's ways of organizing their communities. Approach your research with curiosity and respect, especially when studying Indigenous or traditional systems.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Final Step:</strong> After your research, spend 2-3 minutes thinking: What aspect of this society might inspire your own ideal society design?</p>
